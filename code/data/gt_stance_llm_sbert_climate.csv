  Food security is not just a Michigan challenge, it is a global one. Global estimates state that by 2050, there will be 9.7 billion people in the world, and we will require approximately 70% more food than what we consume now. The SOLUTION to meet these needs requires a cross-sector approach with an emphasis on food loss and waste; including analyzing consumption of food purchased and distributed, and agriculture productivity with metrics of the impact on global climate and the environment. 
  
  
 

  There is NO other way; the challenge both locally and globally is too big to overcome without cross-sector collaboration.

  We are not doing enough in terms of how we produce and use food. However, there is hope. There are signs that technologies and attitudes are evolving to address these challenges, which warrants optimism for where food is headed. The challenges we face, though daunting, should not prevent us from optimism for the future! 
  
  
 

  The Michigan food bank network’s challenge is to CREATE positive change in the world of the families who deal with the toxic stress of food insecurity. More people are rallying around the cause, and we are gaining momentum to overcome this challenge. Join us by keeping #FOODFIRST!

  Here are a few commonly-asked questions:
  
  
 

  Will a solar park permanently remove agricultural land from farming use?
  
  
 

  Nope! After the project’s lifespan is complete, equipment will be removed and the land can be returned to its original use.
  
  
 

  Do solar parks impact the value of nearby property?
  
  
 

  Evidence shows that solar parks DO NOT have a negative impact on rural property values (there’s actually some evidence to suggest that it can increase property values). Solar panels have a limited visual impact, similar to greenhouses –– they typically aren’t taller than 10ft and can be shielded from view using fencing and/or landscaping. 
  
  
 

  How will local wildlife be impacted by Blue Marmot Solar Park?
  
  
 

  Like all utility-scale solar parks in the U.S., Blue Marmot will undergo extensive studies and approval processes regarding natural resources, habitat conservation, and wildlife impacts. Through careful site selection and thoughtful project design, impacts to the land and nearby wildlife can be mitigated or avoided entirely.
  
  
 

  Are solar panels safe?
  
  
 

  Solar energy is one of the safest forms of power generation available. The sun provides a tremendous resource for generating clean and sustainable electricity without toxic pollution or global warming emissions. Millions of families choose to put solar panels on their roofs and literally sleep beneath them.
  
  
 

  Blue Marmot will use silicon-based PV panels, which are made of safe, well-tested materials commonly used in other building and household products. The panels are fully sealed, preventing trace metals from escaping into the surrounding soil. Solar manufacturers are committed to responsible end-of-life management and the solar industry is proactively developing collection and recycling processes for retired panels. 
  
  
 

  Are my tax dollars funding Blue Marmot Solar Park?
  
  
 

  Blue Marmot Solar Park will not be receiving cash payments or loans from the government. Instead, the project will qualify for the same federal tax credit that homeowners can receive for installing solar panels on their property.
  
  
 

  In fact, Blue Marmot Solar Park will significantly increase the local tax base, generating approximately $10 million dollars in additional revenue for schools and other infrastructure or services Lakeview residents rely on.",CustomerBasedAltEnergy,1,Blue Marmot Solar Park,CustomerBasedAltEnergy,CustomerBasedAltEnergy

  25% of the West Coast’s commercially-caught salmon come from the Tongass, and ⅓ of the culverts on the Tongass’ thousands of miles of taxpayer-funded, poorly maintained logging roads impede fish passage. It’s long past time for the Forest Service to focus its funds and staff time not on taxpayer-supported clearcutting of the forest’s remaining old growth, which is vital to wild salmon, biodiversity, and climate change resilience, but on sustainable, culturally thriving, economically beneficial uses of the Tongass, including the visitor industry, recreation, Indigenous consultation and co-management, and commercial fisheries. Reinstating the Roadless Rule is an important step in that process.

641605993535165,"For a long time, I thought that logging wasn’t really an issue for the Tongass anymore. But in my early 20s, I realized that there were actually some massive timber sales still happening, and I felt like they weren’t getting national attention. It’s actually really easy to not notice those things as a Southeast Alaskan; When you have a timber industry reliant on round-log exports where most trees just get cut down and sent overseas, with very limited local processing or jobs, then you’re not going to notice the timber industry unless you see the clearcut. And most of the clearcuts in Southeast Alaska are happening in remote places. Once that land is logged, people stop visiting it. When I was growing up, there were bays and mountains around my home that we’d never hike, or hunt in, because they’ve been totally torn up by logging. It’s all too easy to ignore how aggressively the industry has been clearcutting in the past couple of decades. 
  When Trump was elected I realized that the environment and wild places were going to be hit hard by his policies. I also wanted a meaningful way to confront the threat of climate change. I know that I have limited capacity for political stuff, so I felt that I should focus everything I was feeling to try to be a better steward of the place I was from. Because I grew up in the Tongass and depend on the Tongass for my livelihood, and because the Tongass is such an ecologically significant place, I decided to learn more about what was going on with forest management. 
  I wasn’t sure where to start, but I felt that not many people had a sense of the scale of the Tongass and its significance. Myself included. I wanted to ground myself in the realities of what the timber industry has done to the forests, and what’s still standing. 
  For me, that meant putting on a backpack and exploring these incredible places and really trying to get a sense of what clearcut logging and extractive development means on a landscape scale.

  Food security is not just a Michigan challenge, it is a global one. Global estimates state that by 2050, there will be 9.7 billion people in the world and we will require approximately 70% more food than what we consume now. The SOLUTION to meet these needs requires a cross-sector approach with an emphasis on food loss and waste; including analyzing consumption of food purchased and distributed, and agriculture productivity with metrics of the impact on global climate and the environment. 
  
  
 

  There is NO other way; the challenge both locally and globally is too big to overcome without cross-sector collaboration.

1889899714498860,"The U.S. National Climate Assessment conducted in 2018 concluded that climate change is already harming people and communities across America. For many Americans, the most personally relevant climate impacts are the significant risks it poses to their health. As the climate continues to warm, these health harms are becoming more frequent, severe, and widespread.
  
  
 

  In October 2014, we found that relatively few Americans were aware of the different health consequences of climate change. However, in our most recent survey—conducted in April 2020—we found that a much larger proportion of Americans now think a number of health harms will become more common in their community over the next ten years as a result of global warming.

  From negotiating lower drug costs for seniors to providing universal pre-school for all 3- and 4-year olds, the Build Back Better Act will deliver real, lasting change to Americans of all ages in every community. With its passage in the House, we are one step closer to slashing families’ child care costs by extending the Child Tax Credit, expanding access to affordable home care for older adults and those with disabilities and reducing health care premiums for more than 9 million Americans. And by making big corporations and the wealthiest pay their fair share, not a single American making under $400,000 will pay a penny more in taxes.
  
  
 

  On top of all of this, the Build Back Better Act invests more than $550 billion to deliver the largest effort to combat climate change in American history. By cutting pollution, reducing energy costs and creating new good-paying jobs through this bill, we are finally ensuring America leads the world in creating a 21st Century clean energy economy.

491721535703040,"THE IMPACT OF FOOD ELITISM
  By Jaclyn Krymowski for Protect The Harvest
  Access to adequate food is an extremely important topic. All people deserve to have access to safe and nutritious foods. In today’s society, there are numerous questions to ask about food, food security, and the recent focus on elite foods.
  • Are various food-focused social justice initiatives really pushing towards the goal of safe, nutritious foods, or are they working to redefine what safe and nutritious means?
  • Do the groups who are trying to make “safe” and “nutritious” simultaneous with buzzwords like “organic,” “plant-based,” and “all-natural,” know what impact their actions have on food equity?
  
  Food Bullying is a Reality and It Starts with Food Marketers and Their Counterparts: Animal and Environmental Extremists
  In her book, Food Bullying, author Michele Payn points out that people may find themselves selecting certain food products or labels because of how it will make them feel, increase their status, or earn praise from peers. The choices they make aren’t necessarily derived from nutrition or safety, but from an elitist mindset.
  
  
 

  We Support All Forms of Agriculture – We Do Not Support Misinforming the Public
  There is nothing wrong with providing high quality products to the elite buyer. We support organic farming and conventional farming. We also support different types of animal production systems. What we do not support is the practice of misinforming the public about our food system and the nutritional value of the foods. We believe it is morally wrong to provide disinformation about affordable foods that are the staple of the American public.
  
  
 

  Why are We Making the Statement that these Groups are Partners in Crime?
  Many of these elite food marketing groups and companies tap into the false narrative established by animal and environmental extremist groups to push their own products. Elitist marketers and their counterparts, animal and environmental extremist groups, have purposely overlooked and ignored the reality that our modern food systems provide safe, nutritious, humane and most importantly, affordable food. Through their marketing they repeat the negative disinformation about modern agriculture propagated by animal and environmental extremist groups. Keep in mind that animal extremists want to end all animal agriculture and view animal ownership as akin to slavery and abuse. Environmental extremist groups view humankind as a global parasite and they have been pushing this narrative for years. This provides a convenient, already established narrative that elite food companies and marketers can tap into. Animal and environmental extremist groups are in a sense, saving elite food marketers money since they have already worked to establish a false narrative in which they can use as a platform to sell their food products. They use the false narrative designed and marketed by extremist groups to enforce the false notion that vegan and elite type foods are the epitome of good health.
  
  
 

  What is worse is that marketers for elite foods frown upon families who choose products they deem are “over-processed"" or “unhealthy.” Not only are these accusations unfounded, but those same families simply don’t have the money to spend on expensive alternatives. Without affordable animal protein products like eggs, dairy, beef, pork, and poultry, they’d have no other choice but to go hungry.
  
  
 

  Veganism is Elitist and Unhealthy
  One of the dangers of the vegan animal extremist ideology is their insistence that their proposed diet is suitable for everyone and entirely “natural.” They ignore the facts and put the health of people at risk in favor of their radical ideology. Animal extremist groups also ignore the stark reality that the animal extremist vegan lifestyle requires some degree of supplementation to meet lacking nutrients found in abundance in animal products like B12, iron, and Vitamin D to name a few. Additionally, vegan meat and dairy substitute products like fake bacon, processed pea patties, fake cheese and nut juices that are supposed to replace milk, are significantly more expensive compared to wholesome real meat and dairy products. If those manipulated into following the vegan ideology cannot afford those products they are then only able to afford produce and grain staples.
  
  
 

  From a health perspective, vegan diets are not recommended for everyone. Physicians from all over the world have warned against the dangers of vegan diets in children, citing multiple instances of malnutrition and average delayed growth patterns. In some countries forcing children to eat a vegan diet is considered child abuse and a crime.
  
  
 

  Food Elitism is Not Family Friendly
  Unfortunately, years of plentiful eating have blinded a lot of the elite to the fact that so many under-privileged families rely on our affordable and sustainable food system. The trend of companies serving the elite and wealthy have taken advantage of this ignorance in their marketing tactics.
  
  
 

  Most people cannot afford to shop at high-end grocery stores like Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s and types of farmers’ markets. On average, their groceries are about 20% more expensive compared to traditional stores reflecting a privilege of the elite class.
  
  
 

  Examples of Nefarious Marketing Tactics Which Mislead the Public
  Nefarious food product marketing tactics take many forms. Many marketing firms and elite food companies use scare tactics to sell their products. Using false or exaggerated disinformation, their messaging heavily implies that other foods are nutritionally inferior and unsafe compared to certain products that are produced the “right” way. Of course, the “right way,” is their way. Their marketing messaging fully ignores the facts about food safety and the USDA’s role in ensuring the food items people purchase are safe to consume. What these marketing tactics don’t tell people is that conventionally raised meat, eggs, and dairy fall under the safest food inspections and regulations in the world. Likewise, they have a very similar nutritional profile to food items which are marketed as “pastured raised” or “organic.”
  
  
 

  These scare tactics can be especially harmful to low-income and underprivileged families who are led to believe that they are not and cannot feed their families properly.
  
  
 

  Cooks Venture is an example of elitist marketing and pricing. They are a food delivery service focused on pasture-raised beef and chicken (they have plans to expand their lineup soon). A 9 to 10-pound box of their assorted beef and chicken cuts goes for $149.99. By comparison, the average cost per pound of conventional whole chicken is just $1.70 and beef is $4.73.
  
  
 

  “Good food is vital for health and happiness,” says their website, heavily implying that their meats are ‘good’ compared to other conventionally raised products.
  
  
 

  The site continues:
  
  
 

  “Despite the pastoral images and marketing claims, almost all meat today comes from mainstream operations that are labeled with greenwashed buzzwords. Finding food that is good for both us and the planet doesn’t have to be this hard.”
  
  
 

  While marketing language, this tone is harmful as it reinforces a misconception that is already so rampant among consumers: that products derived from conventional animal agriculture is inferior to niche products sporting labels like “grass-fed” “pasture-raised” “organic” or “all-natural.” Keep in mind that the definitions for some of these products are not even officially defined.
  
  
 

  A company with a similar marketing approach is ButcherBox, which says it “was started with the idea that everyone should have access to high-quality, humanely raised meat.” But is their $149/month delivered box of 9 to 14 pounds of meat really accessible to everyone?
  
  
 

  “We only work with companies and farmers that are dedicated to doing the right thing,” continues the website, “never cutting corners…”
  
  
 

  This is yet another example of a company which is painting conventional, modern animal agriculture as the enemy. The goal is to the shame the elite into purchasing their products and it fully ignores those who cannot afford the high-end products they are pushing.
  
  
 

  Food Insecurity is the Real Issue
  Despite being one of the wealthiest nations in the world, Americans still fall into the “food insecure” category making up about 10.5% of households in 2019, according to data from the Department of Agriculture. In poorer countries, that number is much higher with some having notable portions of their populations being chronically malnourished.
  
  
 

  A pivotal solution to all of this starts, of course, at the farm level. However, the disconnect between large farms, modernization and food equity is unfortunately ongoing. A Global Washington article cites increasing farm efficiency productivity as being necessary to help alleviate the rising cost of food products. This includes “a comprehensive approach that includes access to heartier seeds, more effective tools, improved farm management practices, locally relevant knowledge and reliable markets.” University researchers and livestock veterinarians have dedicated decades to refining modern farming practices to provide humane, sustainable, wholesome, and affordable foods. Large farms, especially those in first-world countries, have embraced the research available to them and implemented modern practices. Unfortunately, the Global Washington article leaves out the vital role of research and modern farming practices. Instead, it cites small farms (without defining what that term means) as being part of the solution.
  
  
 

  Diane Sullivan Fights for Food Security
  In her testimony before the U.S. House Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy on February 6, 2020, food security activist Diane Sullivan, shared her insight into the real-world implications of food elitism as a mother who has experienced hunger and homelessness.
  
  
 

  “Too often, food policy debate in this country exclusively takes place among those in power—elected officials, scholars, researchers, both for-profit and non-profit special interest groups, and more,” she shared. “Rarely are those of us with lived experience in hunger invited to the table when the policies that directly impact our lives are discussed, designed, and implemented. This is increasingly the case as retailers, policymakers, state ballot initiatives, and more press to regulate farmers in such a way that eliminates affordable, safe and nutritious food choices and drives up the cost of our food.”
  
  
 

  Sullivan also commented on the significant role that hardworking farmers and ranchers play in the conventional food system to make food equitable to struggling households.
  
  
 

  “My experience has taught me that productive farmers and ranchers in this country are perhaps among the best friends low-income people could have,” she stated. “They provide us the broadest choices of safe and affordable food options in the world, so long as they are permitted to do so. As low-income consumers, we remain stuck in the middle of policies that increase the cost of our food…”
  
  
 

  In 2016, Sullivan was the campaign manager for a ballot committee that opposed a ban on sales of meat and eggs from animals raised in large modern farms (Massachusetts Question 3) – which is the vast majority of affordable and conventionally raised animal products.
  
  
 

  ""On so many occasions, I've been in a position where I haven't been able to feed my children an appropriate meal,"" Sullivan shared in an interview for a local publication. ""When my SNAP benefits have run out, my paycheck is still a couple of days away, I've been able to go to the grocery store, gather up a dollar in change, purchase a dozen eggs and feed my children at least a source of protein.""
  
  
 

  ""My passion is driving me. I know what hunger looks and feels like. Who's going to take on an organization like the Humane Society of the United States to defend poor people? Poor people are too often voiceless.""
  
  
 

  The Farm Systems Reform Act Will Drive Up the Price of Affordable Food
  In addition to recent attacks on affordable food and modern agriculture like Mass Question 3, California’s Prop 2 and Prop 12, there are animal extremist influenced politicians continuing to push their ideology while ignoring the impact on American families.
  
  
 

  Consider the average monthly expenses of an American family on their grocery bill. Many families are going hungry now and that is without a major disruption to the conventional food system. Such a disruption to animal-derived proteins in particular would be catastrophic. The Farm Systems Reform Act is one of the latest legislative efforts being pushed by vegan extremist Senator Cory Booker. This piece of legislation will harm families in the name of food elitism and vegan ideology and it is being done on the national level.
  
  
 

  Animal Extremist Ballot Initiatives to Drive up the Price of All Food
  In addition to federal legislation, state ballot initiatives in Colorado and Oregon are the most recent targeted attacks on animal agriculture by animal rights vegan extremists. They are pushing to eliminate animal protein products from the diets of citizens in those states under a false animal welfare pretense. These initiatives would cripple the states’ animal industries and force an unhealthy diet on growing families by making affordable and nutritious animal protein products prohibitively expensive. Not only would this cripple animal agriculture, but those farmers growing feed for the animals would also be hit hard if they had fewer ranchers buying their products.
  
  
 

  A Balanced Food System
  Each year hundreds of millions of people go hungry around the globe. Many of those who do have access to food are still deficient in essential vitamins and nutrients. In the U.S. alone, it is estimated over 92% of the population suffers from at least one vitamin or mineral deficiency. At least 10% have a broader type of nutritional deficiency.
  
  
 

  Many of the most common deficiencies found throughout the world can be easily addressed by consuming animal protein products. Iron deficiency, for example, affects over 25% of the world. A single three-ounce serving of ground beef (one of the most affordable beef products) covers almost 30% of the recommended daily value for iron.
  
  
 

  Because vitamin B12 absorption decreases with age, there is an estimated 20% of older adults that are deficient in this vitamin. Meat, milk, and eggs are all abundant accessible sources.
  
  
 

  These are just a few brief examples of vitamins that are essential and found easily in animal products.
  
  
 

  Modern Agriculture Provides Affordable, Nutritious, and Sustainable Food
  Modern agriculture and livestock production practices make food affordable and are more sustainable. They help control food byproduct waste and decrease food disparity among households. Americans today only spend less than 10% of their income on food. For poorer nations, and low-income American households, that percentage is easily 40% or higher.
  
  
 

  Modern state of the art practices in American agriculture have been developed to feed citizens efficiently and affordably. Everything in our food system including research, farming practices, and subsidies all reflect this mindset. Not only are nutritious foods plentiful and accessible, but they also empower consumers with freedom of choice.
  
  
 

  The pursuit of an equitable food system should be about offering more choices, not less, to consumers to meet their dietary needs. Restricting them with only expensive alternatives is food elitism that leaves so many vulnerable families to struggle with life’s most basic necessities.

  The Dangers of Food Elitism 
  By Jaclyn Krymowski for Protect the Harvest 
  
  
 

  Access to adequate food is an extremely important topic. All people deserve to have access to safe and nutritious foods. In today’s society, there are numerous questions to ask about food, food security and the recent focus on elite foods.  
  
  
 

  • Are various food-focused social justice initiatives really pushing towards the goal of safe, nutritious foods, or are they working to redefine what safe and nutritious means? 
  • Do the groups who are trying to make “safe” and “nutritious” simultaneous with buzzwords like “organic”, “plant-based”, and “all-natural”, know what impact their actions have on food equity? 
  
  
 

  Food Bullying is a Reality and It Starts with Food Marketers and Their Counterparts, Animal and Environmental Extremists
  In her book, Food Bullying, author Michele Payn, points out that people may find themselves selecting certain food products or labels because of how it will make them feel, increase their status, or earn praise from peers. The choices they make aren’t necessarily derived from nutrition or safety, but from an elitist mindset.
  
  
 

  We Support All Forms of Agriculture – We Do Not Support Misinforming the Public
  There is nothing wrong with providing high quality products to the elite buyer. We support organic farming and conventional farming. We also support different types of animal production systems. What we do not support and believe is morally wrong is the practice of misinforming the public about our food system and the nutritional value of the foods they can afford to provide their families.  
  
  
 

  Why Are We Making the Statement that These Groups Are Partners in crime?  
  Many of these elite food marketing groups and companies tap into the false narrative established by animal and environmental extremist groups to push their own products. Elitist marketers and their counterparts, animal and environmental extremist groups, have purposely overlooked and ignored the reality that our modern food systems provide safe, nutritious, humane and most importantly, affordable food. Through their marketing they repeat the negative disinformation about modern agriculture propagated by animal and environmental extremist groups. Keep in mind that animal extremists want to end all animal agriculture and view animal ownership as akin to slavery and abuse. Environmental extremist groups view humankind as a global parasite and they have been pushing this narrative for years. This provides a convenient, already established narrative that elite food companies and marketers tap into. Animal and environmental extremist groups are in a sense, saving elite food marketers money since they have already worked to establish a false narrative in which they can use it as a platform to sell their food products. They use the false narrative designed and marketed by extremist groups to enforce the false notion that vegan and other elite foods are the epitome of good health. 
  
  
 

  What is worse is that marketers for elite foods frown upon families who choose products they deem are “over-processed"" or “unhealthy.” Not only are these accusations unfounded, but those same families simply don’t have the money to spend on expensive alternatives. Without affordable animal protein products like eggs, dairy, beef, pork, and poultry, they’d have no other choice but to go hungry.
  
  
 

  Veganism is Elitist and Unhealthy
  One of the dangers of the vegan animal extremist ideology is their insistence that their proposed diet is suitable for everyone and entirely “natural.” They ignore the facts and put the health of people at risk in favor of their radical ideology. Animal extremist groups also ignore the stark reality that the animal extremist vegan lifestyle requires some degree of supplementation to meet lacking nutrients found in abundance in animal products like B12, iron and Vitamin D to name a few. Additionally, vegan meat and dairy substitute products like fake bacon, processed pea patties, fake cheese and juices that are supposed to replace milk, are significantly more expensive compared to wholesome real meat and dairy products. If those manipulated into following the vegan ideology cannot afford those products they are then only able to afford produce and grain staples.
  
  
 

  From a health perspective, vegan diets are not recommended for everyone. Physicians from all over the world have warned against the dangers of vegan diets in children, citing multiple instances of malnutrition and average delayed growth patterns. In some countries forcing children to eat a vegan diet is considered child abuse and a crime.  
  
  
 

  Food Elitism is Not Family Friendly
  Unfortunately, years of plentiful eating have blinded a lot of the elite to the fact that so many under-privileged families rely on our affordable and sustainable food system. The trend of companies serving the elite and wealthy have taken advantage of this ignorance in their marketing tactics. 
  
  
 

  Most people cannot afford to shop at high-end grocery stores like Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s and types of farmers’ markets. On average, their groceries are about 20% more expensive compared to traditional stores reflecting a privilege of the elite class.
  
  
 

  Examples of Nefarious Marketing Tactics Which Mislead the Public
  Nefarious food product marketing tactics take many forms. Many marketing firms and elite food companies use scare tactics to sell their products. Using false or exaggerated disinformation, their messaging heavily implies that other foods are nutritionally inferior and unsafe compared to certain products that are produced the “right” way. Of course, the “right way” is their way. Their marketing messaging fully ignores the facts about food safety and the USDA’s role in ensuring the food items people purchase are safe to consume. What these marketing tactics don’t tell people is that conventionally raised meat, eggs and dairy fall under the safest food inspections and regulations in the world. Likewise, they have a very similar nutritional profile to food items which are marketed as “pastured raised” or “organic”.

  That’s important for our South Side communities and our children. According to a Lurie Children’s Hospital study, 'In Chicago, one in eight families have a child that has been diagnosed with asthma. In fact, the rate of asthma in Chicago children surpasses state and national levels.' However, a 2010 study found that 'park trees can produce significant air quality effects at the local scale, both within and near parks, related to air temperatures, air pollution, ultraviolet radiation, and carbon dioxide.' That’s because 'trees have a strong association of fewer emergency asthma cases in very polluted areas,' according to a 2017 University of Exeter study.

  Today, the Biden Administration’s USDA announced it will restore full Roadless Rule protections, and end large-scale old growth timber sales across the entire 16 million acres of the Tongass National Forest in Alaska! 
  
  
 

  The announcement comes after many years of advocacy by tribal leadership, and local and national groups, including WECAN. On Monday, ahead of the announcement, a WECAN Indigenous Women’s Tongass Delegation met with White House officials to advocate for the protection of the Tongass forest, Indigenous rights and governance, the immediate reinstatement of the 2001 National Roadless Rule, and an end to all old-growth logging throughout the Tongass. 
  
  
 

  The Tongass exists within the traditional territories of the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian peoples. It is one of the largest remaining temperate rainforests in the world, and it is responsible for holding more than 40% of all carbon stored by U.S. national forests. Maintaining an intact Tongass ecosystem is a critical solution for the U.S. and international climate efforts.

599792757899534,"For a long time, I thought that logging wasn’t really an issue for the Tongass anymore. But in my early 20s, I realized that there were actually some massive timber sales still happening, and I felt like they weren’t getting national attention. It’s actually really easy to not notice those things as a Southeast Alaskan; When you have a timber industry reliant on round-log exports where most trees just get cut down and sent overseas, with very limited local processing or jobs, then you’re not going to notice the timber industry unless you see the clearcut. And most of the clearcuts in Southeast Alaska are happening in remote places. Once that land is logged, people stop visiting it. When I was growing up, there were bays and mountains around my home that we’d never hike, or hunt in, because they’ve been totally torn up by logging. It’s all too easy to ignore how aggressively the industry has been clearcutting in the past couple of decades. 
  When Trump was elected I realized that the environment and wild places were going to be hit hard by his policies. I also wanted a meaningful way to confront the threat of climate change. I know that I have limited capacity for political stuff, so I felt that I should focus everything I was feeling to try to be a better steward of the place I was from. Because I grew up in the Tongass and depend on the Tongass for my livelihood, and because the Tongass is such an ecologically significant place, I decided to learn more about what was going on with forest management. 
  I wasn’t sure where to start, but I felt that not many people had a sense of the scale of the Tongass and its significance. Myself included. I wanted to ground myself in the realities of what the timber industry has done to the forests, and what’s still standing. 
  For me, that meant putting on a backpack and exploring these incredible places and really trying to get a sense of what clearcut logging and extractive development means on a landscape scale.

  We heard the phrase #FoodSystems discussed a lot this week during #UNGA 🇺🇳 - Now, here is your quick guide to understanding what they are & why they are important as we try to achieve #ZeroHunger! 
  
  
 

  Basically, food systems revolve around the broader picture of how we produce, transport, process and consume food. Everything from farm to fork. 
  
  
 

  Think about veggies you eat 🍅🌽🥦: 
  🌱Where do the seeds come from? 
  👩‍🌾Where were they planted?
  💧What materials were used to make them grow?
  🚜 How were they harvested?
  📦How were they processed & packaged?
  💵Where were they sold?
  🍽 What was the end-use?
  🛒How were they transported to supermarkets?
  
  
 

  Healthy people require healthy food systems. However, factors like conflict, climate change and COVID-19 are limiting people's ability to access food and putting an intense stain on these systems. 
  
  
 

  🛑Broken food systems = hunger 
  
  
 

  To achieve #ZeroHunger, we need to strengthen these systems and make sure they are inclusive, sustainable and resilient. #UNFSS2021 #SDGs #USAgainstHunger",FoodSecurity,1,World Food Program USA,FoodSecurity,FoodSecurity

According to Lurie Children’s Hospital, 'In Chicago, one in eight families have a child that has been diagnosed with asthma. In fact, the rate of asthma in Chicago children surpasses state and national levels.' Trees have a strong association of fewer emergency asthma cases in very polluted areas, according to a 2017 University of Exeter study.

  In 2001, following a process involving millions of comments and the collapse of the clearcut timber industry, the Roadless Rule protected 9 million acres of the forest from logging roads, while still allowing community interties, hydropower, and other approved uses. In 2020, however, against the will of Tongass residents, Tribes and Americans, the Trump Administration stripped those protections, opening up 186,000 acres of old growth for clearcut logging and all 9.2 million acres for industrialization. The Roadless Rule must be restored in order to defend some of the world’s last remaining old growth temperate rainforest, as well as the jobs, traditional lifestyles, and wildlife those ecosystems support.
  
  
 

  Southeast Alaskans overwhelmingly support the Roadless Rule. More than 90% of local subsistence testimony was in favor of the Roadless Rule.

  The Dangers of Food Elitism 
  By Jaclyn Krymowski for Protect the Harvest 
  
  
 

  Access to adequate food is an extremely important topic. All people deserve to have access to safe and nutritious foods. In today’s society, there are numerous questions to ask about food, food security and the recent focus on elite foods.  
  
  
 

  • Are various food-focused social justice initiatives really pushing towards the goal of safe, nutritious foods, or are they working to redefine what safe and nutritious means? 
  • Do the groups who are trying to make “safe” and “nutritious” simultaneous with buzzwords like “organic”, “plant-based”, and “all-natural”, know what impact their actions have on food equity? 
  
  
 

  Food Bullying is a Reality and It Starts with Food Marketers and Their Counterparts, Animal and Environmental Extremists
  In her book, Food Bullying, author Michele Payn, points out that people may find themselves selecting certain food products or labels because of how it will make them feel, increase their status, or earn praise from peers. The choices they make aren’t necessarily derived from nutrition or safety, but from an elitist mindset.
  
  
 

  We Support All Forms of Agriculture – We Do Not Support Misinforming the Public
  There is nothing wrong with providing high quality products to the elite buyer. We support organic farming and conventional farming. We also support different types of animal production systems. What we do not support and believe is morally wrong is the practice of misinforming the public about our food system and the nutritional value of the foods they can afford to provide their families.  
  
  
 

  Why Are We Making the Statement that These Groups Are Partners in crime?  
  Many of these elite food marketing groups and companies tap into the false narrative established by animal and environmental extremist groups to push their own products. Elitist marketers and their counterparts, animal and environmental extremist groups, have purposely overlooked and ignored the reality that our modern food systems provide safe, nutritious, humane and most importantly, affordable food.  
  
  
 

  Through their marketing they repeat the negative disinformation about modern agriculture propagated by animal and environmental extremist groups. Keep in mind that animal extremists want to end all animal agriculture and view animal ownership as akin to slavery and abuse. 
  
  
 

  Environmental extremist groups view humankind as a global parasite and they have been pushing this narrative for years. This provides a convenient, already established narrative that elite food companies and marketers tap into. Animal and environmental extremist groups are in a sense, saving elite food marketers money since they have already worked to establish a false narrative in which they can use it as a platform to sell their food products. They use the false narrative designed and marketed by extremist groups to enforce the false notion that vegan and other elite foods are the epitome of good health. 
  
  
 

  What is worse is that marketers for elite foods frown upon families who choose products they deem are “over-processed"" or “unhealthy.” Not only are these accusations unfounded, but those same families simply don’t have the money to spend on expensive alternatives. Without affordable animal protein products like eggs, dairy, beef, pork, and poultry, they’d have no other choice but to go hungry.
  
  
 

  Veganism is Elitist and Unhealthy
  One of the dangers of the vegan animal extremist ideology is their insistence that their proposed diet is suitable for everyone and entirely “natural.” They ignore the facts and put the health of people at risk in favor of their radical ideology. Animal extremist groups also ignore the stark reality that the animal extremist vegan lifestyle requires some degree of supplementation to meet lacking nutrients found in abundance in animal products like B12, iron and Vitamin D to name a few. Additionally, vegan meat and dairy substitute products like fake bacon, processed pea patties, fake cheese and juices that are supposed to replace milk, are significantly more expensive compared to wholesome real meat and dairy products. If those manipulated into following the vegan ideology cannot afford those products they are then only able to afford produce and grain staples.
  
  
 

  From a health perspective, vegan diets are not recommended for everyone. Physicians from all over the world have warned against the dangers of vegan diets in children, citing multiple instances of malnutrition and average delayed growth patterns. In some countries forcing children to eat a vegan diet is considered child abuse and a crime.  
  
  
 

  Food Elitism is Not Family Friendly
  Unfortunately, years of plentiful eating have blinded a lot of the elite to the fact that so many under-privileged families rely on our affordable and sustainable food system. The trend of companies serving the elite and wealthy have taken advantage of this ignorance in their marketing tactics. 
  
  
 

  Most people cannot afford to shop at high-end grocery stores like Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s and types of farmers’ markets. On average, their groceries are about 20% more expensive compared to traditional stores reflecting a privilege of the elite class.
  
  
 

  Examples of Nefarious Marketing Tactics Which Mislead the Public
  Nefarious food product marketing tactics take many forms. Many marketing firms and elite food companies use scare tactics to sell their products. Using false or exaggerated disinformation, their messaging heavily implies that other foods are nutritionally inferior and unsafe compared to certain products that are produced the “right” way. Of course, the “right way” is their way. Their marketing messaging fully ignores the facts about food safety and the USDA’s role in ensuring the food items people purchase are safe to consume. What these marketing tactics don’t tell people is that conventionally raised meat, eggs and dairy fall under the safest food inspections and regulations in the world. Likewise, they have a very similar nutritional profile to food items which are marketed as “pastured raised” or “organic”. 
  
  
 

  These scare tactics can be especially harmful to low-income and underprivileged families who are led to believe that they are not and cannot feed their families properly.
  
  
 

  Cooks Venture is an example of elitist marketing and pricing. They are a food delivery service focused on pasture-raised beef and chicken (they have plans to expand their lineup soon). A 9 to 10-pound box of their assorted beef and chicken cuts goes for $149.99. By comparison, the average cost per pound of a conventional whole chicken is just $1.70 and beef $4.73.
  
  
 

  “Good food is vital for health and happiness,” says their website, heavily implying that their meats are ‘good’ compared to other conventionally raised products. 
  
  
 

  The site continues:
  
  
 

  “Despite the pastoral images and marketing claims, almost all meat today comes from mainstream operations that are labeled with greenwashed buzzwords. Finding food that is good for both us and the planet doesn’t have to be this hard.”
  
  
 

  While marketing language, this tone is harmful as it reinforces a misconception that is already so rampant among consumers: that products derived from conventional animal agriculture are inferior to niche products sporting labels like “grass-fed” “pasture-raised” “organic” or “all-natural.” (Keep in mind that the definitions for some of these are not even officially defined.)
  
  
 

  A company with a similar marketing approach is ButcherBox, which says it “was started with the idea that everyone should have access to high-quality, humanely raised meat.” But is their $149/month delivered box if 9 to 14 pounds of meat really accessible to everyone?
  
  
 

  “We only work with companies and farmers that are dedicated to doing the right thing,” continues the website, “never cutting corners…”
  
  
 

  This is yet another example of a company which is painting conventional, modern animal agriculture as the enemy. The goal is to shame the elite into purchasing their products and it fully ignores those who cannot afford the high-end products they are pushing.
  
  
 

  Food Insecurity is the Real Issue
  Despite being one of the wealthiest nations in the world, Americans still fall into the “food insecure” category making up about 10.5% of households in 2019, according to data from the Department of Agriculture. In poorer countries, that number is much higher with some having notable portions of their populations being chronically malnourished.
  
  
 

  A pivotal solution to all of this starts, of course, at the farm level. However, the disconnect between large farms, modernization and food equity is unfortunately ongoing. A Global Washington article cites increasing farm efficiency productivity as being necessary to help alleviate the rising cost of food products. This includes “a comprehensive approach that includes access to heartier seeds, more effective tools, improved farm management practices, locally relevant knowledge and reliable markets.” University researchers and livestock veterinarians have dedicated decades to refining modern farming practices to provide humane, sustainable, wholesome, and affordable foods. Large farms, especially those in first-world countries, have embraced the research available to them and implemented modern practices. Unfortunately, the Global Washington article leaves out the vital role of research and modern farming practices. Instead, it cites small farms (without defining what that term means) as being part of the solution. 
  
  
 

  Diane Sullivan Fights for Food Security
  In her testimony before the U.S. House Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy on February 6, 2020, food security activist, Diane Sullivan, shared her insight into the real-world implications of food elitism as a mother who has experienced hunger and homelessness.
  
  
 

  “Too often, food policy debate in this country exclusively takes place among those in power—elected officials, scholars, researchers, both for-profit and non-profit special interest groups, and more,” she shared. “Rarely are those of us with lived experience in hunger invited to the table when the policies that directly impact our lives are discussed, designed, and implemented. This is increasingly the case as retailers, policymakers, state ballot initiatives, and more press to regulate farmers in such a way that eliminates affordable, safe and nutritious food choices and drives up the cost of our food.”
  
  
 

  Sullivan also commented on the significant role that hardworking farmers and ranchers play in the conventional food system to make food equitable to struggling households. 
  
  
 

  “My experience has taught me that productive farmers and ranchers in this country are perhaps among the best friends low-income people could have,” she stated. “They provide us the broadest choices of safe and affordable food options in the world, so long as they are permitted to do so. As low-income consumers, we remain stuck in the middle of policies that increase the cost of our food…”
  
  
 

  In 2016, Sullivan was the campaign manager for a ballot committee that opposed a ban on sales of meat and eggs from animals raised in large modern farms (Mass Question 3) – which is the vast majority of affordable and conventionally raised animal products.
  
  
 

  ""On so many occasions, I've been in a position where I haven't been able to feed my children an appropriate meal,"" Sullivan shared in an interview for a local publication. ""When my SNAP benefits have run out, my paycheck is still a couple of days away, I've been able to go to the grocery store, gather up a dollar in change, purchase a dozen eggs and feed my children at least a source of protein."" 
  
  
 

  She added:
  
  
 

  ""My passion is driving me. I know what hunger looks and feels like. Who's going to take on an organization like the Humane Society of the United States to defend poor people? Poor people are too often voiceless.""
  
  
 

  The Farm Systems Reform Act Will Drive Up the Price of Affordable Food
  In addition to recent attacks on affordable food and modern agriculture like Mass Question 3, and California’s Prop 2, and Prop 12, there are animal extremist influenced politicians continuing to push their ideology while ignoring the impact on American families.  
  
  
 

  Considering the average spending of an American family on their monthly grocery bill, and that many are still going hungry, the disruption of the conventional food system – particularly animal-derived proteins – would be catastrophic. The Farm Systems Reform Act is one of the latest legislative efforts being pushed by vegan extremist, Senator Cory Booker. This piece of legislation will harm families in the name of food elitism and vegan ideology and it is being done on the national level. 
  
  
 

  Animal Extremist Driven State Ballot Initiatives Will Drive up the Price of Affordable Food
  In addition to federal legislation, the animal extremist driven state ballot initiatives in Colorado and Oregon are other new targeted attacks on animal agriculture by animal rights vegan extremists. They are pushing to eliminate animal protein products from the diets of citizens in those states under a false animal welfare pretense. These initiatives would cripple the states’ animal industries and force an unhealthy diet on growing families by making affordable and nutritious animal protein products prohibitively expensive.
  
  
 

  A Balanced Food System
  Each year, hundreds of millions of people go hungry around the globe. And, even for those with access to food, many are still deficient in essential vitamins and nutrients. In the U.S. alone, it is estimated over 92% of the population suffers from at least one vitamin or mineral deficiency. At least 10% have a broader type of nutritional deficiency. 
  
  
 

  Many of the most common deficiencies found throughout the world can be easily addressed by consuming animal protein products. Iron deficiency, for example, affects over 25% of the world. A single three-ounce serving of ground beef (one of the most affordable beef products) covers almost 30% of the recommended daily value for iron.
  
  
 

  Because vitamin B12 absorption decreases with age, many older adults (an estimated 20% of them) are deficient in this vitamin. Meat, milk and eggs are all abundant, accessible sources.
  
  
 

  These are just a few brief examples of vitamins that are essential and found easily in animal products.
  
  
 

  Modern Agriculture Provides Affordable, Nutritious and Sustainable Food
  Modern agriculture, including livestock production, makes food affordable, is more sustainable, helps to control food byproduct waste, and decreases food disparity among households. Americans today only spend less than 10% of their income on food. For poorer nations (and low-income American households) that percentage is easily 40%, in some cases much more than that. 
  
  
 

  Modern, state of the art practices in American agriculture have been developed to feed citizens efficiently and affordably. Everything in our food system – from research to farming practices to subsidies – all reflect this mindset. Not only are nutritious foods plentiful and accessible, but they also empower consumers with freedom of choice.
  
  
 

  The pursuit of an equitable food system should be about offering more, not less, choices to consumers to meet their dietary needs. Restricting them with only expensive alternatives is food elitism that leaves so many vulnerable families to struggle with life’s most basic necessities.

  ""Build Back Better"" is President's Biden's #1 goal for his Presidency and was created with direct input from AOC, Ayanna Pressley, and the rest of ""The Squad"". If it becomes law, Build Back Better would cost American Taxpayers:
  
  
 

  $1.75 Trillion in new federal spending.  
  Over $555 Billion in spending for “Green New Deal” climate change programs.
  
  
 

  Over $400 billion in new spending for “universal” preschool for 3 and 4 year-olds.
  
  
 

  $80 Billion worth of budget increases for the IRS in order to expand their investigative abilities.
  
  
 

  In addition to the left wing spending spree, Build Back Better would also:
  
  
 

  Shield an estimated 7 million illegal aliens from deportation by changing policies within the Department of Homeland Security.
  Would require 1 million additional ""affordable"" housing projects be built nationwide.
  
  
 

  Would entitle every worker in America a taxpayer-funded 4 weeks’ worth of off days per year, despite the ongoing worker shortage. 
  Build Back Better is a travesty to American Taxpayers. The taxing and spending will only accelerate the dangerous inflation that Americans are experiencing. Democrats are attempting to unilaterally pass the bill through the House in just a few hours.

907080269949877,"Hi, my name is Summer Lee, and I’m an organizer, state legislator, and progressive candidate running for Congress in Pennsylvania's 18th district. We are in a wide-open primary in this pivotal state, and we’re building a people-powered campaign to win real power for working families — and we want to build it with you. Here’s why: 
  
  
 

  I first ran for office in order to take on a status quo that had left communities like ours behind and to win real victories for working families across my home. Together, our people-powered campaign won big — unseating a 20-year incumbent and amazingly DOUBLING voter turnout in our district — and sent me, a young, progressive, working class organizer and advocate to become the first Black woman ever elected to the State Legislature from Western Pennsylvania. 
  
  
 

  Now, I’m running for Congress on these same values, to fight for real victories for working people, to make progress towards environmental, economic, and racial justice, and to center the voices and experiences of our communities and voters who have too often been left behind.  
  
  
 

  We need elected officials who don’t just talk the talk. We need ones who’ll fight the fight — for a healthy environment, for tackling our climate crisis, for unions and creating good-paying jobs, for health care, housing, and racial equity. And we can win all of that and more — if all of us who share these values pitch in to join this work today.
  
  
 

  We are approaching our first major deadline — at midnight on December 31st, we must disclose everything our campaign has raised since we launched in October. That means our fundraising numbers will be on full display for our opponents and pundits to see and judge the strength of the movement we are building. It is critical that we have strong numbers to report, which is why we are asking our grassroots supporters to chip in $5 or $10 to reach our goal. Anything you can give helps prove we have momentum to win this race.",AgainstCorporateInterests,1,Summer Lee for Congress,AgainstCorporateInterests,AgainstCorporateInterests

  According to NOAA IPCC these trees:
  
  
 

  1. Store 10x more carbon than regular trees
  2. Store carbon 100x longer than regular trees
  
  
 

  Could that mean it's 1000x better at storing carbon (10x * 100x)?
  
  
 

  Maybe.
  
  
 

  But let's say the stats are way off.
  
  
 

  Let's say these trees are only 5x better at storing carbon and do it 20x longer.
  
  
 

  That's STILL 100x better than regular trees.
  And what's more...
  
  
 

  The destruction of these trees is 0.1% of destruction of regular trees, but destroying that 0.1% was responsible for 10% of all GHG emissions
  
  
 

  What if instead of cutting down 0.1% of these trees we decided to plant 0.1% or simply conserve 0.1% of these trees back?

  Tune in for Food First Michigan this Sunday at 9:00 PM on WJR Radio to hear from Dr. Phil Knight, Gerry Brisson, president and CEO of Gleaners Community Food Bank and Sheril Kirshenbaum, executive director of Science Debate, host of Serving Up Science at PBS Digital Studios and Michigan State University academic specialist. Sheril continues to blind us with science and discussed two challenges that are seemingly impossible to solve: climate change and food insecurity. Sheril helps us understand the link between climate change and food security and how we might accomplish the impossible and change the outcome of both. 
  
  
 

  Sheril works at the intersection of agriculture and climate – studying how we produce, consume, and waste food. This all plays a huge role in the emissions we create, but also the opportunity we have to address climate change. Sheril says it best that, “food is the victim, the cause, and the solution to climate change.” If you’re interested in learning more, check out the books linked below:

Commenting in support of the Forest Service’s planned reinstatement of the Tongass Roadless Rule is an awesome way to ensure that intact salmon bearing watersheds remain healthy. TAKE ACTION HERE: https://secure.ngpvan.com/X7His7suSkKYyDH8ADtCgg2
  
  
 

  The Forest Service is working with the Biden Administration to restore the Roadless Rule to the Tongass, which was stripped in 2019 despite wide outcry from folks in-region and across the country. In the final comment period in 2019, 96% of public testimony was in favor of keeping the Roadless Rule in place in the Tongass, and more than 90% of in-person testimony in rural communities was in favor of keeping the Rule in place. This is a situation where the action is clearly aligned with the will of the people in the region and the needs of our fisheries and our warming planet.
  
  
 

  -Access to salmon fisheries is based on the performance of wild index streams, which are scattered throughout the Tongass.
  -Strong run performance is directly tied to intact watersheds.
  -26% of all of Southeast Alaska’s jobs are directly tied to the living forests.
  -Southeast Alaska has one of the largest estuary systems in the world.
  -Estuaries provide erosion control, help purify water, are breeding grounds for a variety of animals, and are nurseries for salmon, forage fish, and shellfish. 
  -75% of all fish caught in Southeast Alaska use its estuaries during some part of their life history, including salmon, halibut, sablefish and rockfish.
  -The Tongass produces 25% of West Coast Salmon.
  -The Tongass National Forest is responsible for storing 44% of total carbon absorbed by national forests in the United States. It is critical for both climate mitigation and resiliency.

  It has become heartbreakingly common for people to choose between paying for their medication and putting food on the table. Or for children to develop asthma because of the pollution that blankets their homes. Or for working families to see their wages stagnate while CEO pay skyrockets. All of these problems are because our elected officials have chosen to prioritize corporations and a privileged few over our communities they’re supposed to represent. 
  
  But we can make a different choice. We can choose to invest in our people, our communities, and our environment. We can build a future where all working people, of all races, ages, and backgrounds can thrive — but only if we all come together united in the belief that Congress should reflect the lived experiences, needs, and values of the people it represents. That’s how we won my first State House race, doubling voter turnout and unseating a 20-year incumbent on our shared values. And it's how we’ll build a grassroots movement that can not only win this crucial Pennsylvania election but build real multiracial, multigenerational power, so all working people can thrive.

  In fact, according to energy analyst and policy advisor Miles Farmer, ""FERC commissioners are among the most important decisions [Biden] will make with regard to what the future of energy looks like in the United States.""
  
  
 

  FERC plays a key role in the rapid expansion of interstate fossil fuel infrastructure such as fracked gas and oil pipelines. FERC is tasked with the permitting and regulation of all energy projects that cross state lines. Yet it is well documented that FERC is a rubber stamping agency for the energy industry. FERC has maneuvered to slow the growth of renewable energy and prevent the use of cumulative climate impact assessments in their permitting process.
  
  
 

  While Biden has taken up climate change as a major aspect of his American Jobs Plan, top Biden administration officials have publicly supported false solutions to climate change such as fracked gas, carbon capture, nuclear power, and biomass. The major changes we need, require FERC to act on accurate climate science- NOT the bidding of dirty energy companies. 
  
  
 

  The names floated as possible new FERC commissioners are not promising, reflecting numerous ties to both fossil fuels and false solution schemes.
  
  
 

  We demand that Biden take a stand against false solutions and appoint a new FERC commissioner committed to decarbonization and a rapid transition to 100% renewables.

  BRIEF INFO
  I am an immigrant from Bangladesh. While having various positions in BMCC Lions Club (President), UNA Queens (President), Phi Theta Kappa (VP), sailing club (Dockmaster, Instructor, Race Committee Chair), and completing 2-master degrees in MS in Business Management & Leadership, MS in Human Resource Management, I focused on global issues, such as, Climate change, Women’s Right, Antiwar, Poverty, Hunger, Human Rights issues, UN Funds, etc.
  But, after engaging HOPE Homeless survey and facing corrupt landlord, I soon realized that there was homelessness crisis in NYC. So, I started to advocate for tenants’ rights personally and politically.
  Professionally, I was an IT Director, a Federal employee in the Census Bureau, and a Federal employee in the U.S. Small Business Administration.

As a by-product of that chemical reaction oxygen is produced and released by the tree. It is proposed that one large tree can provide a day’s supply of oxygen for up to four people.
  “Trees also store carbon dioxide in their fibers helping to clean the air and reduce the negative effects that this CO2 could have had on our environment. In one year, a mature tree will absorb more than 48 pounds of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen in exchange.”

 Braven’s patented pyrolysis process allows petrochemical companies, municipalities, and CPG companies to recycle their plastics and produce products for reuse, creating an environmentally friendly supply chain that benefits the business, the consumer, and the planet. Our circular plastic value chain encourages local recycling and positions processing sites close to the customer base and source of waste plastics. This helps businesses become less wasteful and more eco-friendly by reducing the need for long-distance waste transportation and lessening their carbon footprint.

Because recycling is not enough and it is inefficient and varies across the globe. This report tells us that the pellets used to make plastic do end up in the environment because the petrochemical industry does a poor job handling this material. In addition, the EPA has been weakened and it is not as proactive as it is needed. Essentially, plastic pollution occurs along the whole plastics flow chain. As a reminder, when the plastic is eroded by mechanical forces, naturally in the environment, it becomes microplastic. Small particles and fibers that are invisible. Therefore, unknowingly, we are eating, drinking, and breathing plastic. Handling properly the pellets is not equivalent to job losses. There is no excuse to avoid handling better the pellets.

678929149950284,"Fiveash, like any other water treatment plant, needs constant maintenance. I fully agree with spending over $850,000 on repairing this valve. Over the past decade, $120m has been taken out of the utility fund and used to run the city. This was wrong.  
 

 Fiveash currently needs $100m in refurbishments and another $70m for a state of the art filtration system that wouldn’t waste 5m gallons of water per day like the proposed new water treatment plant would.  A new plant would be 4 miles away in the wrong direction from Fiveash’s current location. That would mean roughly $100m in new water lines plus more chemicals added to the water for the additional distance.  
 

 This city commission keeps pledging to make water and sewer a number one priority. Yet the green, yellow or brown city tap water that Ft Lauderdale sells has not improved one bit in the three years since you came into office. Last week, Long Beach California had a 7 million sewage spill that closed down their beaches and made national news. That’s nothing. Last year we had a 250m gallon sewage spill 35 times that size which was warned about in the 2017 Reiss Engineering Report.
 

 Six months ago, Reiss Engineering told you to use ozone and carbon to vastly improve the filtering of city tap water. Not only would it make Fiveash water clear but it would also allow us to stop adding ammonia to pass EPA safe drinking water tests. Instead of five times the allowable levels of chloroform in drinking water during free chlorination burns which last several weeks, we would be in compliance with EPA rules.  
 

 By not moving our water treatment plant into the flight path right next to the executive airport, we could use some of the $260m saved to replace city water lines that turn green water yellow. That’s exactly what happens. Dean, you told me Fiveash has to be moved since the current building can’t withstand a category five hurricane. Could a new plant withstand a plane crash? I don’t think so.
 

 A new plant using Carollo Engineering’s recommended membrane filtration would cost an additional $50m per year just in added electricity costs. Am I missing something here?  
 

 Last city commission meeting, Commissioner Steve Glassman got upset with me for mentioning kickbacks. To be clear, I have absolutely no proof of any kickbacks given or promised to the city commission, city management or city utility employees. 
 

 However, it seems odd that none of you want to talk about engineering reports, filtration techniques, saving $260m or the fact that you sell colored water to a quarter of a million people. The longer you stay silent about this important topic, the more people think that something unscrupulous is going on.
 

 Part II
 

 The city commission has individually met with Ridgewood Infrastructure, a NYC finance company, over two dozen times. Apparently they have put in an unsolicited bid to build a water treatment plant in the flight path of the executive airport to replace Fiveash. Ridgewood is using the faulty Carollo Engineering Report which claims that spending $430m is the best and cheapest way to go.  
 

 Of the 17 listed employees at Ridgewood, only one is an engineer. The rest have backgrounds in finance and most are MBAs. Four people are listed as “senior advisors”. Industry insiders have told me these people are all snake oil salesmen.  
 

 Here’s what their website says: “Ridgewood Infrastructure invests in essential infrastructure in the U.S. .... We invest in leading companies with high barriers to entry and transformative growth opportunities…. We take an active role in managing our investments and add value through the implementation of proven strategies. Through our investment strategy, we create compelling core infrastructure assets and businesses.”
 

 In layman’s terms, what they are saying is they will take a simple job of filtering water and will royally screw over the 250,000 water customers in 7 Broward County cities who will be dependent on them in order to maximize profits for their investors.  
 

 Green water currently comes out of Fiveash and it turns yellow as it goes to the beach. Ridgewood wouldn’t be responsible for water lines. They could always blame bad water quality on bad city water lines.  
 

 The engineers at Reiss Engineering have been working with Ft Lauderdale’s water and sewer systems for 3 decades. Over the past 4 years they have devised a plan to refurbish Fiveash for $170m which would save $260m over Carollo’s plan. It would only take a couple years to implement their plan. The city would still retain ownership of city tap water facilities. We need to stop wasting time with the unsolicited bids and move forward with the Reiss plan.  
 

 Commissioner Ben Sorensen you have publicly supported a “robust new $430m plant”. Ben, you had a conference call with Reiss Engineering, the utility director and Bob Bowcock with the Erin Brockovich Foundation. Yet you remain silent on this issue. Why? Robert, I’ve seen you debate for 30 minutes about an office upstairs that you don’t even use. Does Dean allow you to talk? Many of the constituents in your district can’t afford a $2,000 whole house water filter. Have you even read the engineering reports? Did you meet with Ridgewood Infrastructure? Residents have a right to know.
 

 End of speeches.
 

 The city manager said they were going to talk about Fiveash, building a new water treatment plant and and the unsolicited bids since the legal timeframe of not being able to talk about them had already passed. But he explained that since Commissioner Robert McKenzie didn't show up at the meeting (in person or via zoom) it was decided to not talk about it.  
 

 They will make a decision on whether or not to accept a $430m unsolicited bid on January 18. This is all the notification to be given on this nearly half billion dollar decision. Anyone that is concerned with their green or yellow water should show up to this meeting at 6 pm. Everyone will be given a chance to speak for 3 minutes.",WaterManagementandSustainability,1,Boyd Corbin,WaterManagementandSustainability,WaterManagementandSustainability
407236964318678,"October 21, 2021 Fort Lauderdale City Commission Speech 
  
 

  Why does the city want to move ahead with a $430 million public/private partnership (P3) with a private NYC finance company to build a new water treatment plant when Fiveash can be refurbished for half the cost? You are paying Ernest and Young $65k to review P3 unsolicited bids which means residents will be drinking green or yellow water for another 5-10 years full of toxic chemicals like chloroform which are currently twenty times the maximum safe level. Last week’s water test showed 404 parts per billion of chloroform when it should be under 20 ppb.  
  
 

  Other chemicals were found to be way over the limits which can cause fetal retardation, liver and kidney problems. This has got to stop now.  
  
 

  Reiss Engineering completed a pilot study earlier this year outlining a way to use ozone, carbon and bio filtration to clean up our disgusting city tap water within a year or two.  
  
 

  The 250,000 water consumers in 8 Broward County cities that get their water from Fiveash will be stuck with much higher bills to pay for the unnecessary construction of a new water treatment plant miles away from where it should be. Water bills will also have to pay for the profits of the investors of the private company that the city will hand over the running of our drinking water. This is unacceptable. Do kickbacks to the city commission and utility workers have anything to do with this terrible decision?
  
 

  It seems that the city of Fort Lauderdale wants to just bulldoze Fiveash because they will be too embarrassed to rebuild it since millions of dollars of work that should have been done in maintenance simply wasn’t done and the money shared with many pockets.  
  
 

  Or is it that the city commission just wants a piece of this $430m contract which leaves water bills to the reckoning of the lawyers of the private firm (which there are many). If the city wants to throw around a couple hundred million dollars then they should just replace the water lines which turn the green Fiveash water yellow as it travels to the beach. It’s disgusting. And so are the morals of this city commission. Ben Sorensen, you’re a preacher. Do unto others, right? I’m 100% positive that your daughters aren’t drinking this water. You’re too smart for that. 
  
 

  All the other commissioners including the mayor are in this for the politics. The money. The favors. Fuel for their political future. And you too Ben???
  
 

  Quit playing games with our drinking water. Even if we drink filtered water or bottled water, we still have to shower in these toxic chemicals. Most third world countries have better water than we do and our water bills are already extremely high. They will probably double after this encore of an extreme utility failure. Last year 250 million gallons of raw sewage flowed into city rivers and canals killing most marine life. Then you fixed that sewer pipe with plastic instead of ceramic epoxy coated iron pipe so you could brag about how fast it got fixed. Idiots. 
  
 

  Get some SOLICITED bids to fix Fiveash the way that Reiss Engineers have been telling you to do it for the past 30 years. It’s not rocket science. Just filter our drinking water properly. That’s all.",WaterManagementandSustainability,1,Boyd Corbin,WaterManagementandSustainability,WaterManagementandSustainability
523539652224916,"I've previously talked about the four categories of your Newton City Bill. Since people seem to talk most about their “water” bill, I will first address the “water” part of your Newton City Bill.
  It goes without saying that water is a precious resource and we should pay close attention on how much we use, when we use it, and for what we use it for.
  So, let's dive right in!
  How do we measure usage and how are we charged for Water?  
  Newton measures their water in cubic feet – not in gallons.  
  There are 7.481 gallons per cubic feet of water.  
  Newton water customers pay $ 17.65 for the first 200 Cubic feet
  They also pay $5.95 per 100 Cubic Foot for water used over the base of 200 Cubic Feet.
  So – your first 1,496 gallons costs $ 17.65  
  Each 748 gallons over that base amount costs % 5.95
  It’s hard for a family to stay below the 200 cubic feet of water usage each month, but when you go over that base 200, the price per Cubic feet declines. In reviewing various water usage customer accounts, it was very clear no two households are the same. Comparing one bill to another is very difficult without digging into why bills are different. Large families that take quick showers don’t use as much water as a retired couple that takes long showers. Lawn and garden water can make a difference – some people have wells they use to water grass and plants.  
  We also need to remember what we are paying for in our water bill - it’s not just “water”. We also pay for water production (pumping/well maintenance/well power), treatment, transmission, distribution, storage, EPA and State regulation compliance, replacement of meters, maintenance, water rights, billing/collection, and a slew of other things. Just imagine the cost of replacing each of 8,500 water meters over a 20-year period. 
  As a Newton Resident, you have the right to expect to have water when you need it. You also have the right to expect the water to be of clean and drinkable. In order to do this – maintenance is required on all of the wells, lines, towers, pump stations, booster stations, fire hydrants, valves, and other components of your water delivery system. Having the right water pressure and volume is also important – redundancy is also important so when maintenance is being performed at one location, water can still be delivered in another. 
  The City Budget – Water Department
  The Water Department has a $ 5.4 Million Budget
  $ 1,342,215 is allotted for equipment replacement and infrastructure projects
  The water tower project by Sand Creek on 1st street is likely the next project 
  Sometime the City saves for 4-5 years to do a project like this
  Also included in the water are bond and interest payments on prior projects
  Since the Water Department is a business within a business, they have the normal business expenses of 
  Salaries, equipment maintenance, fuel, supplies, etc.
  The most debatable expenditure is likely the transfers for administrative cost sharing and property tax relief. These amount to $ 570,000 for this past year. The debate is whether to attach the cost of transfers to property and include them in the mill levy – or to let water users that are tax exempt pay for their water bills since they pay no real estate taxes.  
  If I have time in my research, I will verify how the Newton City Mill Levy compares to the Mill levies of other communities with which we compete for economic development projects. Often times, economic development prospects compare mill levy to mill levy in communities they are looking to expand into – even though the actual mill levy might not actually be a “apples to apples” comparison. But – they still likely look a one mill being higher in one community over that of another community and often times pick the lower number to concentrate on. And I have been told by multiple people that our actual mill levy, when compared to other communities in our city peer group, is the highest. So, even though you might want your water bill to be lower, keeping you mill levy is important too. I will try to talk about this more in the future.
  In conclusion, after reviewing water costs and what the city charges for water, the amount of money we pay, specifically for water, is fair in my estimation. I do not feel the “water” portion of our bill is the culprit.

557568325490999,"As Mayor I will find the answers to solve our water problems! Martin’s flat and the precedents it sets to get water from Cedar Canyon and alternate basins is only one of many ideas I will pursue.  

In 1959 I was 11 years old and in Clemont Adams’s 6th grade class. He took us on a ﬁeld trip up Cedar Canyon to see the city’s water system. We stopped here and there, and ﬁnally arrived at Martin’s Flat. Martin’s ﬂat is the ﬂat spot just before you start the steep climb into Ashdown Gorge. There was (and still is) a small block building. Mr. Adams had a key and he opened the door. The children lined up and each had a chance to stand in the door and look at the “gadgets” inside. I was interested, and remember the experience today. Then, Clemont Adams said; “This is the best water in Utah”.

Today the block building remains with a pipe suspended across Coal Creek (pronounced ‘krik”). There is a well there, and it is 300 feet deep. Power is on the property. The property is owned by the city as is the well. As near as I can find, the well was pumped from 1951 to about 1977, a term of over 25 years.

In Clement Adams’ book “The History of Water in Iron County”, Clement shows the Martin’s Flat well allocated 181 acre feet of water for Cedar City in 2005.

I ﬁnd this fascinating! Why did we stop? Did the pump fail? Did the pipe fail? Was the pipe too small? Or was the water at Quitchipa simpler, easier, cheaper, and faster? I suspect the latter. The water from the wells at Quitchipa is fantastic water and we are very blessed to have it, but the levels in the wells are dropping at a dramatic rate. Have we simply over pumped its capacity?I promise as your mayor to fully explore our water availability from the Cedar Canyon area and beyond Martin’s ﬂat.

 They are saying that rooftop solar is to blame for utility rate hikes, and are lobbying the government to double the cost of rooftop solar and keep it out of reach for middle and working class families. 
 

 The utility campaign would harm people like Ramon Torres, a California solar user from Madera, California. Ramon went solar in 2017 to help lower his costs so that once he retires, he can make the family budget go further. The Torres family loves their solar, and if the utilities get their way, it will mean real consequences for Ramon and his family.
 

 Ramon knows that PG&E is against all solar users, because they only care about making as much money as possible, not regular people. Every time someone goes solar, it hurts PG&E’s bottom line.
