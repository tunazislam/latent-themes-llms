  Rutherford Institute Challenges Facebook's Censorship of COVID-19 Vaccine Critics 
  
 

  Warning against the rising threat to free speech posed by the government’s collusion with large technology companies in order to regulate and control what ideas can be shared on the internet and through social media, The Rutherford Institute has asked a federal appeals court to reverse a lower court ruling and prohibit Facebook from censoring and de-platforming critics of the COVID-19 vaccine in violation of the First Amendment. 
  
 

  In calling on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to allow the lawsuit in Children’s Health Defense v. Facebook to move forward, Rutherford Institute attorneys argue that Facebook acted in concert with U.S. government officials and agencies to suppress and punish Children’s Health Defense for sharing information critical of the COVID-19 vaccine.
  
 

  “We should all be alarmed when prominent social media voices are censored, silenced and made to disappear from Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram for voicing ideas that are deemed politically incorrect, hateful, dangerous, extremist or conspiratorial,” said constitutional attorney John W. Whitehead, president of The Rutherford Institute and author of Battlefield America: The War on the American People. “At some point, depending on how the government and its corporate allies define what constitutes ‘extremism,’ we might all be considered guilty of some thought crime or other and subjected to technocensorship.”

386264453057414,"The question of what government does to protect our rights during a pandemic is likely to come up again and again as world population increases and pandemics become more common.
  
 

  First off, no rational adult can be forced to take a medication or undergo a medical procedure without consent. When someone is underage or irrational, another person may make medical decisions for them, but even then it is not the government making the decision but a relative or caretaker. Government cannot force anyone to take a vaccine because individuals have the right to make their own personal medical decisions no matter what anyone else thinks of them.
  
 

  A second point is that businesses can set requirements both on their customers and their employees. If a business wants to only serve customer wearing masks or employ people who have been vaccinated – so be it. They are free to do so. This is again not a government decision.
  
 

  So when a menacing disease takes hold and spreads throughout the population, what should government do?
  
 

  The best way to frame this is as an attack on the people of the United States. Something is killing us – maybe the elderly, maybe those who have commodities – who is dying doesn’t matter. Government never should restrict our freedoms except to protect rights, but when people are infecting each other with a contagion, we have to remember this principle:
  
 

  *** Do as you please as long as you don’t harm, impose on, or place others at risk without their consent. ***
  
 

  Simply put, no one has a right to spread disease.
  
 

  Now some might object, “Well, we don’t know we are infectious.” Actually that doesn’t matter. Just because we aren’t aware doesn’t make putting others at risk OK. Or someone might say, “There are all kinds of diseases out there. How can I live without EVER getting someone else sick?” Sure, we live with many diseases that can cause death – influenza, UTIs, etc. We all accept a background level of risk that arises just from living.
  
 

  The difference during a pandemic is that the level of risk is demonstrably, unusually high. It is easy to look at ‘Weekly All Cause Mortality’ for the United States (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm) and see that COVID-19 is not a seasonal flu.
  
 

  Knowing that we have an obligation not to place one another at excessive risk, most responsible people will take recommended steps without government mandates. We will wear masks, distance, avoid crowds, quarantine appropriately, and take safe and effective vaccines when they become available. We don’t want to be the person who spreads a disease that kills someone else.
  
 

  Sadly, not everyone will act responsibly.
  
 

  So what should government, that agency charged with national defense and managing public space, do to protect our right not to be placed at risk without our consent?
  
 

  Government can’t make us take a vaccine. We never allow government to make personal medical decisions.
  
 

  But government can require that we behave ourselves in the public space, either by wearing masks or even avoiding public space or public gatherings through quarantines to prevent us from harming one another.
  
 

  In private, where we have consented to the risks, we may do as we please. If I go to a private home, I can ask “Has everyone been vaccinated? Will everyone wear masks?” And if the answer is no, I can decide whether or not to take the risk. If I proceed, then I consent to any risks posed thereby.
  
 

  Government doesn’t normally regulate what happens in the private space, but when someone elevates the risk of all those around him, government does step in - someone who builds a bomb or purifies ricin or raises venomous snakes in their apartment, for instance. Bringing large groups of unprotected people closely together in a restaurant or cinema or home effectively creates a transmission “bomb” that raises the risk of infection to many others, and so government may reasonably restrict that activity. This may mean economic hardship for some – and the answer to that is act quickly and decisively so that the hardship lasts for as short a time as possible. The US didn’t do that but some other countries did.
  
 

  Government cannot force individuals into medical decisions, but it can mandate not placing one another at risk without consent.

3.11212E+15,"Can You Get a Religious Exemption from a COVID Vaccine Mandate?
  
 

  By Mike Farris, ADF President & CEO
  
 

  Can people with religious objections to mandatory COVID vaccination get an exemption? Maybe. The answer to this question depends a great deal on a number of factors, and it will vary greatly in individual cases. But the law does provide for this possibility in some situations. 
  
 

  ADF is getting an unbelievable number of requests for legal advice regarding vaccine mandates—far, far more than we could ever handle. 
  
 

  So, we have done what is within our capacity to help people who have sincere religious objections to these mandates. We have prepared a summary and FAQs about the relevant law—not as legal advice but solely as information—for the public. These resources are available at https://ADFlegal.org/resources/covid19-vaccine-mandate.
  
 

  We have also prepared a very detailed legal analysis, which we will make available for free to any lawyer seeking to help a client with a religious exemption. This analysis is only available on request and won’t be posted on our website. 
  
 

  But here are the basics. 
  
 

  First, your objection to the vaccines has to be based on your religious beliefs. It is okay if you are also dubious about the vaccines from a health perspective or about the mandates from a freedom perspective, but neither of those objections standing alone would qualify you for a religious exemption. 
  
 

  Federal employment law requires every employer with fifteen or more employees to grant reasonable religious accommodations to their employees, so long as the accommodation doesn’t place an undue hardship on the employer. That is the basic statutory reason why you can claim a religious exemption in the employment context. 
  
 

  You should read our FAQs for basic information about other contexts. 
  
 

  ADF is not saying that individuals should or should not be vaccinated. We are simply trying to help people who have bona fide religious objections get the full protection of U.S. law on religious freedom.

  The CDC recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future. In fact, pregnant and recently pregnant people are more likely to get severely ill with COVID-19 than non-pregnant people. The vaccine can protect a pregnant person from getting seriously ill or being hospitalized due to COVID-19.
  
 

  Research shows that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. Scientists have found no safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated late in pregnancy or their babies. There is no increased risk for miscarriage among people who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine before 20 weeks of pregnancy. The vaccines do not cause infertility or have other long-term effects.

In order to get to know me a little better, I have provided below the full questions and answers for the Bangor Daily article for you.
  
 

  INTERVIEW: full questions from the Bangor Daily with my unedited answers. 
  
 

  1. What motivated you to run as a candidate for the Ellsworth School Board of Directors?
  
 

  I am running to be reelected because I still have so much work to do for our district. I have worked tirelessly to bring our board to a state of higher transparency in order to make sure we operate with the feedback of all stakeholders. Now that this board is open to this critical input, it is a top priority that we stay involved and engaged. Our policies, goals, and vision statement need to reflect this. I personally hope to achieve this by making sure that every student; without regard to race, religion, gender, economic status, and much more can walk through that door and have an equitable school experience that results in a positive move forward. Equally, every staff member needs the same employment opportunity with zero stereotypes or stimas and needs to be supported with all the tools and training needed to do the job as well as a contract and working environment that motivates each staff member to stay. This means keeping informed and proactive as a board member in order to understand and take action on all the needs within our district. 
  
 

  As we well know, these needs are bound to change with not only each year, but also every situation (such as covid). I will continue to look at the individual needs of our district and make decisions based on what will best improve our goal of success and safety. Thus far, half of my time serving on the board has been during this pandemic. As all of you know, the learning curve to this is steep. I have had the distinct advantage of having a husband who is a pharmacist that currently serves on the federal disaster team, and who also wrote the federal guidelines for what to do in all types of disasters (pandemics, nuclear war, dirty bombs, viral warfare, hurricanes, floodling, etc.) while he served on a presidential committee for then president Obama. This has given me unparalleled access to critical information as this crisis unfolds. Not only do I get information on changes from the CDC in real time, I also get WHO information and information as to how other government agencies around the world are responding. This is vital to understanding how our own agencies make rulings, and how effective or non politically motivated those rulings are. That way I have a crystal clear picture of how this impacts us locally, and the domino effect for each ruling. It has been and will continue to be my top priority to get all of us through this covid crisis safely. I believe I can continue to do so while providing an opportunity for the best educational experience to happen in our district. 
  
 

  2. Do you have children who are enrolled in the Ellsworth school system? If so, what grades are they in?
  
 

  Yes. We have a child in middle school. 
  
 

  3. Do you have a working background in education? What do you do for work now?
  
 

  My family has lived in Ellsworth for 16 years. I went to college for early childhood education and school psychology. My passion for education stems from the long line of educators in my family. While working and going to college, I volunteered at schools in FL where my relatives worked for 7 years before coming to Maine. I worked as a sub in Ellsworth for 5 years, and was so impressed by the warmth and dedication of our Ellsworth teachers. When I had a child at last and enrolled her in Ellsworth, I jumped into volunteering in our schools, and have loved getting to work with these wonderful people. I have been part of the PTF for going on 8 years. Organizing and volunteering in all kinds of things, like Harry Potter week, Halloween night, Holiday gifting day, field days, the Walk A Thon, the Grand program with or schools, Book Fairs, and much more. It gives me such joy to make the education experience engaging and inviting for our kids.
  
 

  I am self employed. I work as a private contractor for business needing help creating and managing thier online business. I am also a costume maker on the side. I regularly volunteer for The Grand. During the pandemic, I started the non profit group 'Masks For Hancock County' where we sewed and shipped thousands of masks for anyone who needed them, as well as a variety of PPE for frontline workers in Hancock as well as all over Maine and across the country. 
  
 

  4. Are you in favor of continuing to require masking for students, staff and visitors inside city schools and facilities as long as Maine CDC recommends the practice to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Hancock County? If you would change that requirement, how would you do so?
  
 

  At the current case load and vaccine availability, yes, I am in favor of wearing masks. I agree that masks help slow the spread of covid, but I don't think masks should be universally mandated when Hancock reaches a status of Green and the vaccine has been offered to 5 and up. Our votes need to reflect real time situations unfolding in our county at the current time. Waiting on national standards or even state standards to relax our rules means our kids would stay masked until places like Tampa, FL and Portland, ME got their case loads down, regardless of what was happening in our town.*
  
 

  5. Do you favor continuing to have crosswalks painted in rainbow Pride colors at the city’s high school and elementary/middle school? Why do you favor or oppose doing so?
  
 

  100% yes. I advocated and voted for this already. For kids old enough to understand what the rainbows stand for, it makes a clear statement of inclusion in an environment that had previously felt insular. For those too young to understand, they see it as a brilliantly colored crosswalks. They brighten the atmosphere for everyone. 
  
 

  6. Are there other issues that you feel are important for the Ellsworth school system to address that you feel are not being adequately addressed? If so, can you identify a few of them and say what steps you would pursue to address those issues as a member of the school board?
  
 

  Pre-pandemic, I was working on many areas that I would like to get back to. School climate for everyone. Students, staff and families. We have started down the path of diving deeper into the culture within our walls to make sure we are providing the best environment to give each person a chance to thrive. This needs evaluating is many areas, like employee contracts, equity of education and inclusion, anti bullying, planning for success past high school, curriculum and grading updates, and better communication within the district as well as a continued transparency**. 
  
 

  7. What else would you like voters to know about you, or about what you hope to accomplish as a school board member?
  
 

  . I am a huge fan of data, but not necessarily a fan of standardized tests. Teachers need to have easy access to standardized test data, as it is one of many tools used to help steer the boat, but it's not the entire story. 
  
 

  Teachers are the scientists of the school, putting together daily plans of action to best produce optimal student outcomes based on previous data. When we as a board make changes, we need to talk to these educators for their analysis and data, and always use multiple resources of credible information to shape our plans. 
  
 

  One of my biggest accomplishments while serving on the school board was getting a bill sponsored that got signed into law. A law that improves public education for every student and teacher in Maine. This is a pretty rare accomplishment. I did this by listening to the families and staff about what some of the biggest challenges are in education. Our public schools have become choked with mandates that take up copius amounts of school time. Many mandates are out dated, underfunded, and even redundant. This law is a massive step in cleaning up that system, and making education the best it can be. Of I get the privilege of a second term, I have plans for another bill I hope to have sponsored to help our high school students through the state.
  
 

  Someone was asking about where I stood on mandates for the covid vaccine in our schools. I thought this is a perspective that people have a right to know about. I love this vaccine. I couldn't wait to get it, and got my child vaccinated as soon as we could. However, I don't believe my personal feelings about the vaccine should ever infringe on you making your own choices for you and your family. Row v Wade gave us all the right to medical privacy. I would much rather make my husband (a pharmacist who is one of the people tasked with the vaccine roll out for MDI, and who helped write policy on how to handle pandemics under president Obama) available to answer any and all questions a person might have about the vaccine. I want people to want this for themselves. I will make sure they have all the scientific information. And I will respect everyone's privacy no matter what they choose to do. I believe in my body my choice, and plan to stand by that.
  
 

  * information and recommendations from the WHO differed from the CDC on masks wearing. Both being very credible sources, all the information needed to be read and analyzed. During the pandemic, my husband had meetings with the CDC where the CDC changed their own rulings sometimes 3x in ONE day on the same issue. This is one of the reasons we need to understand not only each recommendation, but also the reasons why those recommendations are made and the local impact.
  
 

  **Fact. I was the first Ellsworth School Board member to regularly reach out to citizens through social media to keep people better informed. I ushered our school board into an age of information and transparency that had never existed at this level before I took office. Transparency matters. I didn't just promise something, in my 3 years on the board I pushed HARD for this and took it to a whole new level. I already have plans in the works with my fellow policy committee member to bring about a new district run information outlet on social media for all parents and guardians to have centralized information with easy access in the future. If you looked back to the last time the board got to do the board self evaluation (recorded and archived online) you would know just how hard I pushed for this, and what I was up against when I came on the board 3 years ago.",CommunityServiceByCandidate,CommunityServiceByCandidate,authority/subversion,CommunityServiceByCandidate
353110443204446,"What we now know about how to fight the delta variant of COVID 
  
 

  Opinion Column from Tampa Bay Times
  
 

  An expert explains why vaccines — and masks — are so important, and why delta is different and more dangerous.
  
 

  I am in a unique position to report on what is going on with COVID-19, particularly the delta variant and why it’s so dangerous, and how it interacts with the vaccines. I’m the Special Assistant to the National Director of Pathology and Lab Medicine for the entire Veterans Affairs system, with a specific role in advising on elements of COVID testing for the system.
  
 

  As such, I have a front row seat to all of the latest data since we use that information to make our national-policy decisions. So, here are a few important points that help explain why you should get vaccinated and wear a mask. I’ll do my best to stitch this all together so it makes sense:
  
 

  1. Like Gorilla Glue. The delta variant (lineage B.1.617.2) has a particular collection of mutations in the spike protein (that knob-like projection you see in renderings of the virus) that make it extremely effective in attaching to human cells and gaining entry. If the original COVID strains were covered in syrup, this variant is covered in ultrafast-drying Gorilla Super Glue (industrial strength).
  
 

  2. 1,000 times higher. There are two recent publications which demonstrate that the viral loads in the back of the throats of infected patients are 1,000 times higher with the delta than with previous variants. I can tell you from data in my own labs, that is absolutely true. We are seeing viral signals we never saw last year using the exact same assays.
  
 

  3. Much more infectious. This much higher load plus the ultra “stickiness” of the delta strains for adhering to human cells makes it remarkably more infectious than previous strains. You may have heard of R0 (Pronounced R naught) which is, in a nutshell, the number of people to which an infected person would be expected to transmit the virus. Early versions of the virus had a 2 to 2.5 R0 value. So one infected person would infect two or so people on average. Delta has an R0 of about eight! In the infectious disease world, that’s almost unheard of. Chickenpox and measles are about all we have ever seen that spread that efficiently from human to human. This changes the story line completely from earlier in the pandemic and makes this surge, in many ways, like a completely different pandemic event.
  
 

  4. Five days. There is another recent publication out of Singapore with data that confirms something we suspected. I will explain more about the “why” on this below when I talk about vaccines, but the gist is this: The viral loads in the throats of vaccinated persons who become infected with delta rises at identical rates as in unvaccinated persons, but only for the first few days. After five days or so, the viral loads in the vaccinated person start to quickly drop whereas those in the unvaccinated person persist. This key set of observations is important for several reasons relating to vaccinated persons serving as vectors for spread (see below).
  
 

  5. Young people. This pandemic, Round 2, is primarily being observed in younger patients than in Round 1. Our children’s hospitals are even already filling up or full. Because of the delta viral dynamics, it is much more capable of causing severe disease in a larger swath of the population. You spew enough of any human pathogen on someone without immunity, and it’s not going to end well. This sets up very poorly for the beginning of the school year — which has already started in Florida — and it scares me. Check that. It is actually terrifying. I sure hope we have vaccines for the 5- to 11-year-olds soon.
  
 

  6. Vaccines work! Speaking of vaccines. Are they working? Yes! They are absolutely doing their expected job. We know a lot about vaccines for upper respiratory viruses, as we have been giving the population one every year for decades (influenza). To explain all of this, I need to provide some biological context. When you get a vaccine as a “shot,” the “antigen” in the vaccine leads to formation of an antibody response. You probably knew that. What’s important, though, is that it primarily leads to a specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) response. That’s the antibody type that circulates around in really high numbers in the blood, is located some in tissues and is more easily detectable by blood tests, etc.
  
 

  What that shot does not do is produce an Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody response to the virus at the surface of the throat mucosa. That’s the antibody type that could prevent the virus from ever binding in the first place. As such, in a vaccinated person, the virus can still attach like it’s about to break into the house, but it doesn’t realize that there is an armed homeowner on the other side of the door. When that virus is detected, the IgG beats it up and clears it before the person gets very ill (or ill at all). (Sidebar: Anyone ever had their kid — or themselves — get the “Flumist” vaccine as their annual flu booster? The idea there is to introduce the antigens at the surface of the throat mucosa leading to that IgA response that will prevent infection from happening at all. Sounds good and still has a place, but it isn’t quite as effective overall as the shot.)
  
 

  7. Preventing disease and death. The COVID-19 vaccines are designed to prevent disease/death through that IgG response (though it does also reduce infections somewhat). How good are the vaccines at doing all of this with delta? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has just released data addressing that very question. Punchline: They’re remarkably good! The vaccine shows an 8-fold reduction in the development of any symptomatic disease secondary to delta. For hospitalization, it is a 25-fold reduction. That’s 25 times! Remarkable. For death, it is also 25 times! This is a very effective pharmaceutical class when looking at overall efficacy toward the intended/expected purpose. When looking at the very tiny side effect profile, I’d personally consider it one of the best overall pharmaceuticals on the market in any class of drugs.
  
 

  8. So, you’re vaccinated? First of all, a sincere, heart-felt thank you! But you may now ask, so why do I again need to wear a mask? We talked about disease, hospitalizations and death above, but what about infections themselves? The vaccines are now estimated to provide a 3-times reduction in infection. For reasons that I tried to make clear above, it isn’t surprising that the vaccine is less effective at preventing infection vs. preventing disease. We are indeed seeing detectable virus, at high levels, in asymptomatic, vaccinated persons when we test them prior to procedures, etc. We have a few that are mildly symptomatic, too.
  
 

  While we now understand that the virus fades from the back of the throat pretty quickly in a vaccinated person, we also know that an infected, vaccinated person can transmit this very infectious virus to others for at least a couple of days. So, as before, you are being asked to wear a mask to primarily protect others.
  
 

  We need you again to interrupt the transmission cycle of the virus, as you don’t know when you might be infectious. The vaccine alone cannot interrupt this cycle when there is a lot of virus in the community within unprotected persons.
  
 

  9. What’s next? I live and practice in Iowa, and I see the tsunami wave on the horizon. It’s typical for respiratory viruses to begin in the southern United States (where it is hot and everyone clusters indoors in the air conditioning to escape the heat) and then creep north to affect those areas when it gets colder (and people go inside because it’s getting colder). If you live in the north and are not vaccinated, it is not too late, but it’s getting damn close. It’s also time to start wearing masks in public again (ugh...I hate it, too).
  
 

  Those of you in the south, particularly in Florida, know that the tsunami is already on your shores. If you weren’t already off the beach, you might be in trouble. However, if you are there and haven’t yet been affected, run like hell to metaphorical higher ground — get vaccinated, wear a mask.
  
 

  I beg of you, watch that wave and don’t ignore it. I have zero political agenda (I hate politics). I’m just a nerdy scientist and physician who loves you all, and I certainly don’t want to see a mass of my friends grieving — or dead — because I didn’t yell loud enough to get you and your families off that beach. So, run! (to your pharmacy ... driving is allowed). You don’t want any part of this thing without vaccine on board.

  The Christian County Headliner reached out to all of the city council candidates with 5 questions for us to answer. These answers will be published in the newspaper, but I'm not sure when. In the meantime, I thought I would go ahead and share my answers here:
  
 

  1. List any relevant qualifications or experiences you would like voters to know about:
  
  
 

  I am an active and well-known volunteer, leader, and advocate in the area (with PROMO, GLSEN, Free Mom Hugs, Nixa MO Diversity Advocates, etc.), and already have working relationships with members of the city council and administration, the police department, the school administration and board, and other city leaders. In addition, I was a member of the Strategic Planning Advisory Committee which crafted Nixa’s next 5-year strategic plan. As such, I’m invested in the plan and eager to be a part of its implementation. With my previous and ongoing civic involvement, in addition to my body of experience and skills, serving my community on city council is the next logical step, and one I’m very passionate about taking!
  
 

  
  2. What action, if any, should the Nixa City Council take in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic or in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19?
  
 

  
  It seems like Nixa has been doing a good job already of slowing the spread, and I believe that with the availability of the vaccine, there’s light on the horizon. We’re not out of the woods quite yet, though, and we must take care to avoid a resurgence. I believe that wearing masks and physical distancing, in addition to getting vaccinated, are still the best steps we can take over the next few months. Once the current mask mandate is ended, I think that the best thing council can do is to continue to encourage (and serve as an example to) Nixans to wear masks and physically distance, and to get vaccinated when eligible. I believe that businesses should remain open and some events should start to take place again, with proper precautions in place. And the more of us who are vaccinated, the sooner we will all be able to get back to normal.
  
 

  
  3. What is your opinion about the level of accessibility that the Nixa City Council has with the general public?
  
 

  
  I believe that council has done a great job of being accessible and transparent. Meetings are always posted on the city’s website as well as social media, and agendas are available to the public ahead of time, so that residents can plan ahead as far as attending or speaking at meetings. District 1 council member Jarad Giddens has been very proactive about keeping his followers informed on social media, and our city’s Director of Communications, Drew Douglas, goes above and beyond to disseminate information. All that said, there is always room for improvement, and the city’s 5-year plan includes a website overhaul as well as the creation of an interactive app for residents. There are also plans to create a virtual streaming platform for city council meetings, for those residents who can’t attend in person. I’m excited about these changes, and think that they will move the city to a whole new level of accessibility!
  
 

  
  4. Is there an area of city government that you hope to develop advanced knowledge of in the future? If yes, describe.
  
 

  
  I can’t necessarily point to one single area, as I’m fascinated with all of them! I want to learn as much as possible, and plan to do so while continuing my civic involvement whether or not I’m elected to council. Most issues are not black and white, but rather have a lot of grey area, and I really enjoy the challenge of working within that grey area to find solutions. In attending city council meetings and listening to ordinances being debated and residents speaking about issues, I have consistently noted that there are usually valid points on both sides of an issue. Much of the time, decisions made by the council will make one group of people happy and one group unhappy - that’s a very tough spot to be in! But it’s this process of weighing pros and cons and figuring out which solution would best serve the greater good which intrigues me, and which I think I’m very well-suited for. I’m a logical thinker who is very detail-oriented, analyzes problems from all angles, and thinks outside of the box when necessary. In addition, I feel that I have a strong ability to empathize with others – to put myself in their shoes. Many issues brought before city council would not affect me personally, but that doesn’t mean that I wouldn’t care about them or take them seriously. I believe strongly that part of being a contributing member of society is recognizing that something shouldn’t have to affect you personally for it to matter to you – we should all care about each other. My great passions in life are problem-solving and helping others, and as a member of council, I would be able to put those passions to work and be a voice for ALL Nixans.
  
 

  
  5. What level of involvement should Nixa have in partnering with other local governments such as Ozark and Christian County and with regional economic development groups? Why?
  
  
 

  I believe that Nixa should have the highest possible level of involvement in partnering with other local governments and regional economic development groups, and from what I have seen so far, I think that it strives to do so. Nixa does not exist in a bubble and cannot possibly thrive unless it works in concert with other local governments and agencies. Nixa, Ozark, and Christian County as a whole share the same issue of being “bedroom communities” – our residents may live here, but a great majority of them work in another municipality. This presents unique challenges to our economies, and there is much to be gained by working together to address these challenges, share ideas, and collaborate in creating solutions. It can be tricky for a bedroom community to find a good balance between supporting local small businesses (We have some really wonderful small businesses here!) and welcoming new businesses which will bring more money and jobs, thereby boosting the economy and infrastructure and better balancing the tax burden. I’m eager to be a part of finding and maintaining that balance.",CommunityServiceByCandidate,CommunityServiceByCandidate,authority/subversion,CommunityServiceByCandidate

  TO THE EDITOR: Mendham Township has been fortunate to have had the hard working and dedicated Township Committee members of Sarah Neibart and Nick Monaghan for the last three years.
  
 

  Under their leadership, they have cut taxes without cutting services. In fact, they have expanded our shared services regarding courts, animal control services and are also working to share tax collection services.
  
 

  Although rumors might have one think otherwise, the DPW (Department of Public Works) has the same budgeted staff in 2021 as in 2020. And with a contracted landscaping crew available, the DPW has more time to focus on stormwater control maintenance and road repair with their new asphalt hotbox.
  
 

  After too many years of talk without action, the township is finally getting a new police station which is designed to fit perfectly in the historic district of Brookside. Simultaneously our Town Hall and Library will get the needed critical renovations and improvements to update them for the safety and well being of all who use them.
  
 

  Communication has never been better, especially since the pandemic. I was especially grateful during that period of isolation to receive updates from our mayor, Ms. Neibart, several times a week with information about covid and links to other services, vaccine availability and such.
  
 

  These committee members also give their time to the town through additional volunteer efforts. Nick Monaghan has been on the First Aid Squad for 12 years and Sarah Neibart is with the Brookside Engine Company.
  
 

  Mendham Township has flourished with these two people at the helm. Keep Mendham Township headed in the right direction and vote for Sarah Neibart and Nick Monaghan

  Cancel culture is alive and well! 
  
 

  Recently, LifeSiteNews was permanently de-platformed by pro-abortion and LGBT groups (GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign, and NARAL Pro-Choice America) for “false information about COVID-19 that could contribute to physical harm.” Facebook also said that they de-platform Facebook pages that publish “vaccine discouraging information on the platform.”
  
 

  Big Abortion and Big Tech are colluding to censor pro-lifers, using the well-researched information about coronavirus vaccines as a pretext.
  
 

  The fact is sexual revolutionaries are leading the charge in censoring pro-life speech. In this episode, Mark discusses how pro-life advocates are undermining our efforts to change culture by welcoming our enemies inside the gates.
  
 

  Some of the questions that will be answered are:
  • How should we respond? 
  • Should pro-life groups create alliances with pro-LGBT groups and individuals to fight abortion? 
  • What about Francis Schaeffer’s notion of co-belligerency? 
  • How far should we go in developing joint efforts to fight abortion?

On 9/9, Biden announced that all companies with 100+ employees will be required to mandate vaccines or test their employees for COVID at least once per week. He has weaponized OSHA to enforce this clearly unconstitutional mandate.
  Companies that don’t comply will face up to $14,000 for each violation. It could be ruinous to businesses all over the country, including The Daily Wire. 
  This is tyranny. And we plan on fighting Joe Biden’s dictatorial mandate with every resource at our disposal.
  I am vaccinated. I encourage vaccination. But we still live in a free country, where Americans should have the right to make their own decisions. And nothing in the Constitution gives Joe Biden the power to ignore his enumerated role and dictate directly to the American people.
  As I write this post, our legal team is at work preparing a potential lawsuit against the Biden administration. We refuse to go along with this tyrannical edict.
  Like you, I’ve watched in horror at the draconian lockdowns in places like Australia and New Zealand. Citizens there are routinely arrested simply for leaving their homes. Do you think we’re immune to the kind of ugly impulse that has turned a once-free nation like Australia toward authoritarianism?
  Americans have been far too willing to cede their freedoms to authoritarian bureaucrats in the name of “public health.” Enough is enough. We must turn the tide now or risk losing the country you and I love.

  • Booster requirement: A COVID booster shot will be required for all students, faculty, and staff beginning Jan. 31, 2022. If it has been less than six months since your last COVID vaccine, you will be required to get the booster within one month of eligibility.
  • Remote learning: Our spring semester will begin as planned on Tuesday, Jan. 18 and our campus will be open. However, classes for the first two weeks of the semester (Jan. 18-28) will be taught remotely. Staff able to work remotely will do so for the next four weeks and should talk with their supervisors about specific arrangements. We will return to in-person work and instruction on Monday, Jan. 31.
  • Community conversations: To share greater detail on these decisions and to answer your questions, we will hold a ""Community Conversations: COVID"" virtual discussion on Tuesday, Jan. 11 from 10-11 a.m.

  Bloomington, MN City Council District #3
  
 

  PRESS RELEASE
  
 

  October 27th 2021
  
 

  *For Immediate Release*
  
 

  ****************************************************
  
 

  I just learned that the City of Bloomington will fire fifteen police officers who are refusing, for private, personal reasons, to take the COVID-19 vaccine.
  
 

  Many of our police officers have already had COVID and have thus built up natural resistance to COVID. Natural resistance is almost always more effective than vaccine-induced resistance. Why should these officers have to get vaccinated?
  
 

  Our police wear masks and are aware of their surroundings when dealing with other people. The vaccine primarily protects the individual taking it. It does not prevent the spread of the disease. An officer refusing vaccination is taking a personal risk but is not putting others at significant risk.  
  
 

  Therefore, any mandate (Federal or otherwise) that results in the loss of employment over this issue is a violation of the rights of each individual to make choices about their bodies and their medical treatment. The rule “My body, my choice” should apply here.
  
 

  This is just one more example of the erosion of individual rights and civil liberties in Bloomington over the past year. We have seen grown adults lose their right to make choices on the purchase of flavored tobacco products. Homeowners have lost their rights with arbitrary zoning changes with no regard for local input. 
  
 

  For over a year, our self-righteous Mayor and some City Council members have consistently defaulted to a position of restricting individual rights when they have the chance. Courts have intervened and found in favor of Plaintiffs in two such cases now: trash collection practices and the Council’s unconstitutional decision to ban some photography in public parks, which could still cost Bloomington tens of thousands of dollars in attorney-fee awards to the person who sued - two more examples of a City eager to restrict the rights of its residents even in cases our courts have said are un-constitutional.
  
 

  With this latest salvo, the City is once again coming down on the side of telling our police officers what is best for their bodies. Those who are comfortable taking the vaccine have every right to do so and should.  
  
 

  But I stand firmly with those police who are not comfortable being vaccinated, whether because of their natural immunity, religious concerns or for medical reasons, or just the desire as an individual to not take it. I believe Police have the same rights to individual choice as all citizens. They should not lose their jobs for exercising that right. It may even be that the union contract with our police doesn’t allow this sort of restriction – has the City checked? Did they consult with the Union?
  
 

  This isn’t just a medical freedom issue. It is a public safety issue. Police Chief Mike Hartley reported to the City Council in the October 25ty meeting that crime is on the rise in Bloomington. We need every police officer we can get. We are already short officers. Firing fifteen more out of around 125 officers* - about 12% of the total force - for bad reasons makes the staffing situation in Bloomington much worse, puts more load on remaining officers, will cause a plunge in police morale and decrease safety for all of us.  
  
 

  That is unacceptable and I will not stay silent about my support for our police on these issues and for their vital role in our community.

  COVID cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have decreased significantly. There's also a surge in vaccinations. Before Biden took office, more than 16 million people in the country had gotten their COVID-19 vaccine. Today, more than 316 million have gotten at least one shot.
  
 

  An estimated 70% of students are back to full-time, in-person instruction, and more people are going back to work.
  
 

  More than 2 million jobs have been created — that's a monthly average of 540,000 new jobs. The average number of new unemployment claims has also decreased by 50%.

We do not consider people who only get information from internet sources who constantly put out misinformation without fact checking these sources as truly being informed. 
  The Independence Party also respects the right for local jurisdictions like school districts to require masks without the state blocking these mandates. Even students in Dallas ISD can refuse to wear masks but they will be segregated from their normal classroom and placed with other students not wearing masks. I hope parents who push for the right to refuse their children being forced to wear masks know they are putting their children in much greater risk of contracting COVID.
  The Independence Party also respects the right for private companies to require proof of vaccines or negative COVID test in order to pay for that companies services. On September 1st, a new law will go into effect in Texas banning companies doing business in Texas from requiring proof of vaccines. Supposedly, this law is to support people’s right to choose but it is violating private businesses rights to protect their customers. It will be interesting to see how this plays out because concert promoters Live Nation and AEG have both announced proof of vaccine OR a recent negative COVID test will be required to attend their shows. The key here is the OR because the law does not ban requiring a negative test. I think cruise companies will be using this same strategy. I am sure there is going to be court battles over this but if the OR exemption holds up in court, it makes me wonder, did the Texas legislature and governor purposely pass this impotent law knowing it would really do nothing just for political theatre or were they just stupid.",VaccineMandate,AdvocatingUnifiedLiberties,liberty/oppression,MaskMandate

568741900965726,"SOME OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS SO FAR
  
 

  Spread the word.
  
 

  1. Rejoined the Paris Agreement, an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), on climate change mitigation, adaptation, and finance, signed in 2016. (Trump withdrew the U.S. from this agreement.)
  
 

  2. In a letter to UN Secretary-General António Guterres, Biden rescinded Donald Trump's July 2020 intended U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization.
  
 

  3. In January, signed ten executive orders related to the country's COVID-19 response and vaccination efforts. These included Ensuring a Data-Driven Response to COVID-19 and Future High-Consequence Public Health Threats, Establishing the COVID-19 Pandemic Testing Board and Ensuring a Sustainable Public Health Workforce for COVID-19 and Other Biological Threats, Supporting the Reopening and Continuing Operation of Schools and Early Childhood Education Providers, and activating the Defense Production Act in order to speed up vaccine distribution.
  
 

  4. Signed an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal employees to $15 per hour.
  
 

  5. Withdrew Trump's travel ban from Muslim-majority countries.
  
 

  6. Signed the American Rescue Plan into law. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, also called the COVID-19 Stimulus Package or American Rescue Plan, is a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill passed by the 117th United States Congress and signed into law by President Biden on March 11, 2021, to speed up the United States' recovery from the economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing recession. First proposed on January 14, 2021, the package builds upon many of the measures in the CARES Act from March 2020 and in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, from December.
  
 

  7. Signed an executive order creating a task force to reunite children separated from their families as a result of the Trump administration family separation policy.
  
 

  8. Announced sanctions on Russia over the worst-ever hack of U.S. government agencies. (Stands in contrast to Trump's extreme reluctance to do the same.)
  
 

  9. Biden formally announced the full withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan by September 11, 2021, ending the America's longest war.
  
 

  10. Made all adults eligible for COVID-19 vaccination by April 19th, 2 weeks ahead of schedule. As of now 70% of adults in the US have had at least one COVID-19 shot. Although there's been a recent increase due to people who still haven't been vaccinated contracting the Delta variant, overall the number of daily new cases of COVID-19 in the US has fallen substantially since Biden became president.
  
 

  11. Added over 3 million jobs in the first 6 months of his presidency.
  
 

  12. Signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. Prompted by a nearly 150% increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans after the breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic, the legislation, introduced by Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., and Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, aims to make the reporting of hate crimes more accessible at the local and state levels by boosting public outreach and ensuring reporting resources are available online in multiple languages. It also directs the Department of Justice to designate a point person to expedite the review of hate crimes related to COVID-19 and authorizes grants to state and local governments to conduct crime-reduction programs to prevent and respond to hate crimes. A big change from Trump calling COVID-19 the ""China virus"" and the ""Kung Flu.""
  
 

  13. Suspended oil drilling leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
  
 

  14. Signed an executive order expanding voting access that directs the heads of all federal agencies to submit proposals for their respective agencies to promote voter registration and participation within 200 days, while assisting states in voter registration under the National Voter Registration Act. In addition, the order instructs the General Services Administration to modernize the federal government's Vote.gov portal.
  
 

  15. Signed an executive order to restore collective bargaining power for federal workers.
  
 

  16. The American Rescue Plan fulfills Biden's promise to expand the Affordable Care Act, for two years. With its expanded subsidies for health plans under the Affordable Care Act, the coronavirus relief bill makes insurance more affordable, and puts health care on the ballot in 2022.
  
 

  17. Issued an executive order that promotes more competition in the economy. It urges agencies to crack down on anti-competitive practices in sectors from agriculture to drugs and labor. Fully implemented, the effort will help lower Americans' internet costs, lower drug prices, among other steps. The order instructs antitrust agencies to focus on labor, healthcare, technology and agriculture as they address a laundry list of issues that have irritated consumers, and in the case of drug prices, has bankrupted some.
  
 

  18. Signed the Crime Victims Fund Act, a bill to bolster a fund used to support victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and other crimes.
  
 

  19. Signed a bill making Juneteenth the eleventh federal holiday. Juneteenth, now officially Juneteenth National Independence Day, commemorats the emancipation of African-American slaves. It is also often observed for celebrating African-American culture.
  
 

  20. Signed an executive order to increase refugee admissions and allow a safe haven for about 125,000 refugees.",GovTrust,GovTrust,authority/subversion,GovTrust

  'Total Hypocrisy!' Sanders Rips GOP for Pushing Estate Tax Repeal While Rejecting Covid Relief as Too Costly. 
  ""While Senate Republicans told us we cannot afford to provide $1,400 direct payments to the working class, they had no problem introducing a bill this week to repeal the estate tax."" 
  ""Republicans are obsessive about delivering massive tax cuts to their super wealthy friends."" Sen. Chris Murphy. 
  Sen. Bernie Sanders, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, called out Republican members of Congress on Thursday for demanding a permanent repeal of the estate tax—a move that would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans—while simultaneously rejecting the new coronavirus relief package as ""partisan and wasteful."" 
  ""While Senate Republicans told us we cannot afford to provide $1,400 direct payments to the working class,"" the Vermont senator said, ""they had no problem introducing a bill this week to repeal the estate tax which would provide a $1.7 trillion tax break to the billionaire class. Total hypocrisy!"" 
  Led by Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.)—who drew widespread scorn last month for his absurd case against raising the federal minimum wage—Republican lawmakers from both chambers of Congress on Tuesday introduced dead-on-arrival legislation that would fulfill the GOP's longstanding goal of permanently repealing the federal estate tax, a clear indication of their priorities as millions of U.S. households continue to face hunger, illness, joblessness, and eviction. 
  Half of the Senate Republican caucus, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), has signed on to the legislation. Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.) is the lead sponsor of companion legislation in the House. 
  Contrary to the GOP's depiction of the estate tax as a burden on small family farms and businesses, the tax only applies to a tiny fraction of some of the nation's largest estates. 
  ""Only 1,900 estates were valuable enough to owe this tax in 2018, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center,"" HuffPost's Arthur Delaney and Igor Bobic pointed out Thursday. ""Over 90% of those estates came from the top 10% of income earners; almost half of the total tax paid came from the richest 0.1% of Americans."" 
  Warren Gunnels, Sanders' staff director, noted on Twitter that repealing the tax would ""provide a $1.7 trillion tax break to the billionaire class"" and nothing for ""the bottom 99.99% of Americans."" 
  ""Not a single family farm owed an estate tax according to the latest data,"" said Gunnels. ""Not a single one."" 
  In a column on Wednesday, Michael Hiltzik of the Los Angeles Times wrote that ""couching the estate tax repeal as a benefit for America's valiant business and farm owners is a scam."" 
  ""Repealing the estate tax would be a massive handout to rich families, enabling them to concentrate their wealth to an extent the Founding Fathers found inimical to society,"" Hiltzik added. ""When you see Republicans like [Idaho Sen. Mike] Crapo, Thune, and McConnell wringing their hands over the burden on small farms and family businesses, call it for what it is: hogwash."" 
  The Republican Party's latest push for a complete and permanent estate tax repeal came as GOP lawmakers unanimously lined up against a coronavirus relief package that would lift millions out of poverty with direct payments and a major expansion of the child tax credit, extend emergency unemployment benefits, and bolster the fight against the pandemic by providing tens of billions of dollars in new funding for vaccine distribution. 
  The $1.9 trillion measure passed Congress without a single Republican vote in either chamber, and President Joe Biden signed the package into law on Thursday. 
  ""What a wonderful way for Democrats to continue to show the difference between Republican priorities and Democratic priorities,"" Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told HuffPost. ""Republicans are obsessive about delivering massive tax cuts to their super wealthy friends. Democrats just proved we were willing to go big in order to put money in the pockets of lower- and middle-income Americans."" Reddit Politics.

353110443204446,"What we now know about how to fight the delta variant of COVID 
  
 

  Opinion Column from Tampa Bay Times
  
 

  An expert explains why vaccines — and masks — are so important, and why delta is different and more dangerous.
  
 

  I am in a unique position to report on what is going on with COVID-19, particularly the delta variant and why it’s so dangerous, and how it interacts with the vaccines. I’m the Special Assistant to the National Director of Pathology and Lab Medicine for the entire Veterans Affairs system, with a specific role in advising on elements of COVID testing for the system.
  
 

  As such, I have a front row seat to all of the latest data since we use that information to make our national-policy decisions. So, here are a few important points that help explain why you should get vaccinated and wear a mask. I’ll do my best to stitch this all together so it makes sense:
  
 

  1. Like Gorilla Glue. The delta variant (lineage B.1.617.2) has a particular collection of mutations in the spike protein (that knob-like projection you see in renderings of the virus) that make it extremely effective in attaching to human cells and gaining entry. If the original COVID strains were covered in syrup, this variant is covered in ultrafast-drying Gorilla Super Glue (industrial strength).
  
 

  2. 1,000 times higher. There are two recent publications which demonstrate that the viral loads in the back of the throats of infected patients are 1,000 times higher with the delta than with previous variants. I can tell you from data in my own labs, that is absolutely true. We are seeing viral signals we never saw last year using the exact same assays.
  
 

  3. Much more infectious. This much higher load plus the ultra “stickiness” of the delta strains for adhering to human cells makes it remarkably more infectious than previous strains. You may have heard of R0 (Pronounced R naught) which is, in a nutshell, the number of people to which an infected person would be expected to transmit the virus. Early versions of the virus had a 2 to 2.5 R0 value. So one infected person would infect two or so people on average. Delta has an R0 of about eight! In the infectious disease world, that’s almost unheard of. Chickenpox and measles are about all we have ever seen that spread that efficiently from human to human. This changes the story line completely from earlier in the pandemic and makes this surge, in many ways, like a completely different pandemic event.
  
 

  4. Five days. There is another recent publication out of Singapore with data that confirms something we suspected. I will explain more about the “why” on this below when I talk about vaccines, but the gist is this: The viral loads in the throats of vaccinated persons who become infected with delta rises at identical rates as in unvaccinated persons, but only for the first few days. After five days or so, the viral loads in the vaccinated person start to quickly drop whereas those in the unvaccinated person persist. This key set of observations is important for several reasons relating to vaccinated persons serving as vectors for spread (see below).
  
 

  5. Young people. This pandemic, Round 2, is primarily being observed in younger patients than in Round 1. Our children’s hospitals are even already filling up or full. Because of the delta viral dynamics, it is much more capable of causing severe disease in a larger swath of the population. You spew enough of any human pathogen on someone without immunity, and it’s not going to end well. This sets up very poorly for the beginning of the school year — which has already started in Florida — and it scares me. Check that. It is actually terrifying. I sure hope we have vaccines for the 5- to 11-year-olds soon.
  
 

  6. Vaccines work! Speaking of vaccines. Are they working? Yes! They are absolutely doing their expected job. We know a lot about vaccines for upper respiratory viruses, as we have been giving the population one every year for decades (influenza). To explain all of this, I need to provide some biological context. When you get a vaccine as a “shot,” the “antigen” in the vaccine leads to formation of an antibody response. You probably knew that. What’s important, though, is that it primarily leads to a specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) response. That’s the antibody type that circulates around in really high numbers in the blood, is located some in tissues and is more easily detectable by blood tests, etc.
  
 

  What that shot does not do is produce an Immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody response to the virus at the surface of the throat mucosa. That’s the antibody type that could prevent the virus from ever binding in the first place. As such, in a vaccinated person, the virus can still attach like it’s about to break into the house, but it doesn’t realize that there is an armed homeowner on the other side of the door. When that virus is detected, the IgG beats it up and clears it before the person gets very ill (or ill at all). (Sidebar: Anyone ever had their kid — or themselves — get the “Flumist” vaccine as their annual flu booster? The idea there is to introduce the antigens at the surface of the throat mucosa leading to that IgA response that will prevent infection from happening at all. Sounds good and still has a place, but it isn’t quite as effective overall as the shot.)
  
 

  7. Preventing disease and death. The COVID-19 vaccines are designed to prevent disease/death through that IgG response (though it does also reduce infections somewhat). How good are the vaccines at doing all of this with delta? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has just released data addressing that very question. Punchline: They’re remarkably good! The vaccine shows an 8-fold reduction in the development of any symptomatic disease secondary to delta. For hospitalization, it is a 25-fold reduction. That’s 25 times! Remarkable. For death, it is also 25 times! This is a very effective pharmaceutical class when looking at overall efficacy toward the intended/expected purpose. When looking at the very tiny side effect profile, I’d personally consider it one of the best overall pharmaceuticals on the market in any class of drugs.
  
 

  8. So, you’re vaccinated? First of all, a sincere, heart-felt thank you! But you may now ask, so why do I again need to wear a mask? We talked about disease, hospitalizations and death above, but what about infections themselves? The vaccines are now estimated to provide a 3-times reduction in infection. For reasons that I tried to make clear above, it isn’t surprising that the vaccine is less effective at preventing infection vs. preventing disease. We are indeed seeing detectable virus, at high levels, in asymptomatic, vaccinated persons when we test them prior to procedures, etc. We have a few that are mildly symptomatic, too.
  
 

  While we now understand that the virus fades from the back of the throat pretty quickly in a vaccinated person, we also know that an infected, vaccinated person can transmit this very infectious virus to others for at least a couple of days. So, as before, you are being asked to wear a mask to primarily protect others.
  
 

  We need you again to interrupt the transmission cycle of the virus, as you don’t know when you might be infectious. The vaccine alone cannot interrupt this cycle when there is a lot of virus in the community within unprotected persons.
  
 

  9. What’s next? I live and practice in Iowa, and I see the tsunami wave on the horizon. It’s typical for respiratory viruses to begin in the southern United States (where it is hot and everyone clusters indoors in the air conditioning to escape the heat) and then creep north to affect those areas when it gets colder (and people go inside because it’s getting colder). If you live in the north and are not vaccinated, it is not too late, but it’s getting damn close. It’s also time to start wearing masks in public again (ugh...I hate it, too).
  
 

  Those of you in the south, particularly in Florida, know that the tsunami is already on your shores. If you weren’t already off the beach, you might be in trouble. However, if you are there and haven’t yet been affected, run like hell to metaphorical higher ground — get vaccinated, wear a mask.
  
 

  I beg of you, watch that wave and don’t ignore it. I have zero political agenda (I hate politics). I’m just a nerdy scientist and physician who loves you all, and I certainly don’t want to see a mass of my friends grieving — or dead — because I didn’t yell loud enough to get you and your families off that beach. So, run! (to your pharmacy ... driving is allowed). You don’t want any part of this thing without vaccine on board.

  2015 Arthur Ashe Courage Award controversy 
  In June 2015, ESPN's announcement of Caitlyn Jenner, formerly Bruce Jenner, as the recipient of that year's Arthur Ashe Courage Award, one of its annual ESPY Awards, led to significant criticism among online commenters[122] and some members of the media, with Bob Costas calling the decision to give Jenner the award a ""crass exploitation play"".[123] Most of the critics of the Jenner award considered Lauren Hill, who played college basketball despite suffering from a brain tumor that would claim her life only a few months later, a more worthy recipient. Others cited Noah Galloway, an Iraq War double amputee who competes in extreme sports and was also a finalist in the spring 2015 season of Dancing with the Stars, as a worthy candidate.[122]
  
 

  Robert Lee controversy 
  
 

  ESPN made the decision to remove Robert Lee from the broadcast team calling the University of Virginia home opener against College of William and Mary on September 2, 2017 because he shares the same name as Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Robert Lee, who is not related to the confederate general, is of Asian American heritage. The decision was made in the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia which protested the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. ESPN was widely criticized for the move.[124]
  
 

  Jemele Hill tweets about President Trump 
  
 

  On September 11, 2017, SportsCenter anchor Jemele Hill made a series of tweets critical of President Donald Trump, including describing him as a ""white supremacist.""[125][126] ESPN issued a statement saying Hill's comments ""do not represent the position of ESPN. We have addressed this with Jemele and she recognizes her actions were inappropriate.""[127] Hill later clarified that she stood by her comments as representative of her personal beliefs. ""My regret is that my comments and the public way I made them painted ESPN in an unfair light"", she added.[128] Some criticized Hill's comments,[129][130][131] including White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who called them ""a fireable offense by ESPN"";[132] Trump criticized the network and demanded an apology.[128] Others voiced support for Hill[133][134] and criticized ESPN[135] and the White House's responses, arguing that Hill's comments were accurate[136][137][138] and that a White House official suggesting Hill be fired infringed on the First Amendment.[139]

  On October 8, 2019, in the wake of Chinese boycotts of the NBA after Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey made a Twitter post in support of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests,[140][141] it was reported that ESPN's senior news director Chuck Salituro had issued an internal memo directing on-air personalities to not discuss political aspects of the controversy unrelated to their effects on sport, as per prior directives discouraging ""pure politics"".[142][143] On October 10, ESPN faced criticism for displaying a map of China during a SportsCenter report that included Taiwan and the Nine-Dash Line.[144]
  
 

  Doug Adler lawsuit 
  
 

  Former tennis player and ESPN commentator Doug Adler was fired after making an allegedly racist comment about Venus Williams on-air. In January 2017, during the broadcast of the Australian Open match, Adler commented '""Venus is all over her. And you'll see Venus move in and put the guerrilla effect on, charging.""[145] ESPN insisted that Adler used not the word he claimed he said, namely guerrilla, but rather gorilla to describe Williams, who is African-American. Adler apologized for the remark after being told by his superiors to apologize on air, so that he could keep his job, but was fired by ESPN the next day.[146] In February 2017, Adler filed a lawsuit against ESPN for wrongful termination.[147]
  
 

  On-air promotion of Disney+ 
  
 

  In November 2019, ESPN's owner The Walt Disney Company launched the streaming service called Disney+. ESPN was soon accused of hurting its journalistic integrity with its promotion[148][149] of Disney+. For example, there was a Simpsons-themed SportsCenter ""Top 10"" to star NFL reporter Adam Schefter tweeting that Disney+ ""will change lives."" Writing in Slate, Laura Wagner[150] said that the ""tongue bath"" for Disney+ ""represents a new inflection point in ESPN's decline from journalistic institution to entertainment company"". Wagner added ""This clumsy marketing blitz is an embarrassing exercise that turns ostensible reporters into stooges. It's also a stark example of just how flimsy ESPN's editorial vision has become."" Meanwhile, Kelly McBride of the nonprofit journalism organization the Poynter Institute in an interview with The Washington Post[151] said ""You're turning the journalist into a salesperson and asking them to upsell the product. That's not the relationship you want the journalist to have with the audience member. You want that relationship to be about trust in the journalist's expertise.""
  
 

  Accusations of a racist culture behind the scenes 
  
 

  In July 2020, New York Times writer Kevin Draper spoke[152] with more than two dozen current and former ESPN employees, who ""described a company that projected a diverse outward face, but did not have enough Black executives, especially ones with real decision-making power. They said the company did not provide meaningful career paths for Black employees behind the camera and made decisions based on assumptions that its average viewer is an older white man, in spite of its audience trends.""
  
 

  Accusations of political bias 
  
 

  Republican political leaders including Donald Trump[153] and Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson have accused ESPN incorporating their political bias into sports news. A 2017 survey of 1,423 adults found that 30 percent of respondents believed that ESPN was politically biased, of which 63 percent said it is a liberal bias, while 30 percent said it has a conservative bias, and 7 did not categorize it.[154]
  
 

  Sage Steele
  
 

  Sage Steele called people out this week over a lack of response to DeSean Jackson’s antisemitic comments.
  
 

  In Steele’s estimation, Jackson’s recent Instagram rant was not met with the same level of disapproval as Drew Brees’ relatively harmless remarks about not kneeling for the National Anthem.
  
 

  In a social media post on Friday, Steele noted that Jackson’s actions were “undeniably worse” than Brees’. Moreover, she said that the “lack of outrage” over what Jackson said was extremely frustrating to her.
  
 

  “Frustrating to see the lack of outrage for what Desean said, which was undeniably worse than what Brees said” she wrote.
  
 

  “Are we all in on holding ppl accountable for insensitive remarks? Or only when it’s convenient for us?”
  
 

  Steele did not limit her criticism to social media. On Thursday’s SportsCenter, she pointed out that many of the athletes who often say that “silence is compliance” when it comes to matters impacting African Americans are oddly quiet in this instance.
  
 

  Renowned ESPN host Sage Steele found herself at the center of multiple controversies this week.
  
 

  Initially, Steele was pulled off the air on Monday after appearing on Jay Cutler’s podcast and making provocative statements regarding ESPN’s COVID-19 vaccine policy, former president Barack Obama and female reporters.
  
 

  Specifically Steele described her company’s COVID-19 mandate as “sick and scary.”
  
 

  “I respect everyone’s decision,” she said. “I really do. But to mandate it is sick, and it’s scary to me in many ways. But I have a job, a job that I love and, frankly, a job that I need.”
  
 

  Steele then went on to question why President Obama identified as black.
  
 

  “Well, congratulations to the President, that’s his thing,” said Steele. “I think that’s fascinating considering his Black dad is nowhere to be found, but his white mom and grandma raised him, but OK. You do you. I’m gonna do me.”
  
 

  Steele also addressed the topic of female journalists dressing “inappropriately” – something that an SEC reporter landed in hot water for not long ago.
  
 

  “When you dress like that, I’m not saying you deserve the gross comments, but you know what you’re doing when you’re putting that outfit on, too,” she said.
  
 

  For obvious reasons, many called on ESPN to fire Steele for her comments.
  
 

  According to Carlos Greer of the New York Post, however, that is not going to happen.
  
 

  Steele’s punishment will end “sometime next week,” a source familiar with the situation told Page Six. At that point, she will be permitted to return to SportsCenter.
  
 

  “A day hasn’t been set yet,” the source continued. “She’ll be back on-air sometime next week.”
  
 

  This isn’t Steele’s first dance with controversy. She famously took a very strong stance in relation to one NFL player’s offensive commentary – something that didn’t win her too many friends within ESPN.
  
 

  She was also famously bullied by two of her colleagues, with nothing much coming from the incident.

This is egregiously abusive, and should not be legal. It is shameful to treat our frontline workers this way!
  
 

  Currently, there are no protections in statute to prevent this from happening, and the medical freedom reform which took place last Session through SB 8 is not sufficient to address this situation.

We have done great as a city relative to others, but we do need to stay vigilant/aware as the progress we have made is always fragile. 
  
 

  - our vaccination rates for the city continues to be strong with as of last week slightly more than 78% of residents have completed their 1st shot and slightly more than 65% of our residents are fully vaccinated. This is good considering the size of our city and diversity of population with many harder to reach communities, but we want to continue to see these numbers increase . 
  
 

  - our local hospitalization rate continues to be low which is a good sign 
  
 

  - we have seen a slight uptick in cases locally during the month of July. As an example, we are 100 cases above the entire month of June with one week to go before the end of July

The continued politicization of the COVID environment has led to a rise in folks (mainly government) finding new ways to infringe upon your rights. The “vaccination passport” is just the latest in the line of bad ideas!  
  
 

  Since I am a believer that you should NOT have to “show your papers” just to get on an airplane in the United States, and certainly not in Missouri either, yesterday I proposed legislation to ban this practice.
  
 

  Thus my amendment, pictured here, which prevents this kind of tyranny in Missouri. It would ensure you can utilize air, rail, and vehicle travel regardless of the private decision you and your family make about whether or not to get the COVID vaccine. Almost every single Republican supported this amendment—even 1 Democrat supported my amendment!
  
 

  Thank you to everyone who has reached out to support this idea and our efforts on the Senate floor to get this done! And thank you to my Republican colleagues who supported the amendment!

  Government AND businesses cannot, and should not, force COVID vaccines on anyone. We don’t do that in America. I believe all people have the fundamental right to make decisions about their own healthcare without coercion or discrimination by the Government or private business. Rember it's your choice and coercion should never happen from either side of this argument.
  
  When it comes to masking our children, I have seen firsthand in our daycare center that masking kids five and under have real-life negative consequences. It’s up to us to protect those kids without making them cover their faces. 
  
  I don’t want to hear teachers’ unions and others demanding that we put masks on our kids -- while they themselves fight vaccination requirements for themselves, however, Teachers certainly have a choice like you and me whether to be vaccinated or not.

160659649323036,"SOME OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS SO FAR
  
 

  Spread the word.
  
 

  1. Rejoined the Paris Agreement, an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), on climate change mitigation, adaptation, and finance, signed in 2016. (Trump withdrew the U.S. from this agreement.)
  
 

  2. In a letter to UN Secretary-General António Guterres, Biden rescinded Donald Trump's July 2020 intended U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization.
  
 

  3. In January, signed ten executive orders related to the country's COVID-19 response and vaccination efforts. These included Ensuring a Data-Driven Response to COVID-19 and Future High-Consequence Public Health Threats, Establishing the COVID-19 Pandemic Testing Board and Ensuring a Sustainable Public Health Workforce for COVID-19 and Other Biological Threats, Supporting the Reopening and Continuing Operation of Schools and Early Childhood Education Providers, and activating the Defense Production Act in order to speed up vaccine distribution.
  
 

  4. Signed an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal employees to $15 per hour.
  
 

  5. Withdrew Trump's travel ban from Muslim-majority countries.
  
 

  6. Signed the American Rescue Plan into law. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, also called the COVID-19 Stimulus Package or American Rescue Plan, is a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill passed by the 117th United States Congress and signed into law by President Biden on March 11, 2021, to speed up the United States' recovery from the economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing recession. First proposed on January 14, 2021, the package builds upon many of the measures in the CARES Act from March 2020 and in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, from December.
  
 

  7. Biden formally announced the full withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan by September 11, 2021, ending the America's longest war.
  
 

  8. Announced sanctions on Russia over the worst-ever hack of U.S. government agencies. (Stands in contrast to Trump's extreme reluctance to do the same.)
  
 

  9. Made all adults eligible for COVID-19 vaccination by April 19th, 2 weeks ahead of schedule. As of now almost all states that Biden won in 2020 are on track to have 70% of adults vaccinated against COVID-19 by July 4th. The number of daily new cases of COVID-19 has fallen dramatically since Biden became president.
  
 

  10. Added 2 million jobs in the first 4 months of his presidency.
  
 

  11. Signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. Prompted by a nearly 150% increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans after the breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic, the legislation, introduced by Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., and Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, aims to make the reporting of hate crimes more accessible at the local and state levels by boosting public outreach and ensuring reporting resources are available online in multiple languages. It also directs the Department of Justice to designate a point person to expedite the review of hate crimes related to COVID-19 and authorizes grants to state and local governments to conduct crime-reduction programs to prevent and respond to hate crimes. A big change from Trump calling COVID-19 the ""China virus"" and the ""Kung Flu.""
  
 

  12. Suspended oil drilling leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
  
 

  13. Signed an executive order expanding voting access that directs the heads of all federal agencies to submit proposals for their respective agencies to promote voter registration and participation within 200 days, while assisting states in voter registration under the National Voter Registration Act. In addition, the order instructs the General Services Administration to modernize the federal government's Vote.gov portal.
  
 

  14. Signed an executive order to restore collective bargaining power for federal workers.
  
 

  15. The American Rescue Plan fulfills Biden's promise to expand the Affordable Care Act, for two years. With its expanded subsidies for health plans under the Affordable Care Act, the coronavirus relief bill makes insurance more affordable, and puts health care on the ballot in 2022.",GovTrust,GovTrust,authority/subversion,GovTrust

And we all want to go back to in-person learning, as it is much preferred over virtual formats. It’s better for our students and should be a high priority.

  We're proud to recognize Employee Rights Center as the 80th Assembly District’s Nonprofit of the Year! ERC has done so much over the last 20 years to advocate and provide representation for some of the most vulnerable and marginalized workers in our district.
  
  When the pandemic hit, we saw so many left unemployed and confused about how to access support services. ERC was one of the first organizations that worked to transform its normal operation into a resource hub to meet the immediate needs of the community. Just in the last year, ERC has helped organize Census outreach events, COVID vaccination sites, assisted with filling out and submitting EDD claims, partnered with other organizations to provide rental and utility assistance, and helped establish a pantry to distribute food to those in need. As part of its broader mission, the nonprofit also provided resources for disadvantaged workers to stand up against wage theft, health and safety issues in the workplace, and discrimination, regardless of their immigration status. 
  
  That’s just a few examples of the countless ways ERC has supported and helped provide relief to working families in our community during such a difficult year.

884850748880513,"CNN Business: A rise in global crude oil supply could put the brakes on surging gasoline prices that have hit record levels in parts of the United States and Europe.
  
 

  According to the International Energy Agency's latest market report, global oil supplies jumped by 1.4 million barrels per day in October, with the United States accounting for half that increase as Gulf of Mexico output recovered from the damage caused by Hurricane Ida in August.
  
 

  The Paris-based agency said it expected a further boost of 1.5 million barrels per day over November and December, with the United States forecast to provide more of that increase than any other country.
  
 

  ""The world oil market remains tight by all measures, but a reprieve from the price rally could be on the horizon,"" it said.
  
 

  Prices for US and Brent crude oil are trading near six-week highs at $80.15 and $81.62 a barrel. That's left drivers in California paying a record $4.68 per gallon for gasoline, according to AAA. Europe hasn't escaped either. Prices hit record highs in the United Kingdom last month.
  
 

  The IEA said it expected output to increase in the next two months despite the OPEC+ group of oil producing countries declining appeals from US President Joe Biden to ramp up production beyond a planned monthly increment of 400,000 barrels per day.
  
 

  The agency said it had raised its US output forecast by 300,000 barrels per day for the fourth quarter and by 200,000 barrels per day on average in 2022, as high prices encourage higher output.
  
 

  ""That increase will go some way to meet rising demand, still recovering from the 2020 Covid slump,"" the report said, adding that refinery production was also on the rise again, following maintenance over autumn.
  
 

  The agency raised its global gasoline demand forecast for the last quarter of 2021 by 250,000 barrels per day after seeing end-user demand ""on track to strengthen further"" over the rest of the year, as more countries open up to international travel, people become more mobile and Covid-19 vaccination campaigns pick up.

  Yesterday I proposed an amendment to ban ALL mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations in the State of Indiana and attempted to attach it to the redistricting bill. The amendment was found ""not germaine"" and thus, was not voted on in the House. My amendment was pretty much tossed out. House leadership made it very clear, this week, they were only going to focus on re-districting, despite the outcries they heard from thousands around the state to address this Covid-19 vaccination tyranny ASAP. I did everything in my power and at my disposal to pressure House leadership to do what is right, but they refused.
  
 

  GOING FORWARD: The battle is not over. The pressure now needs to be applied to the Indiana Senate. They are back in session next week Monday. Please call and email Senate Pro-tem, Senator Roderick Bray, Speaker Todd Huston, and your State Senator demanding that they ban mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations and proof of vaccination in the State of Indiana ASAP.
  
 

  URGENCY: We cannot wait 6 to 9 months to pass legislation in the 2022 legislative session after hundreds of thousands of other Hoosiers will have had to make the tough decision to forcibly take the vaccine to be able to keep their job or decline the jab and lose their job. Also, many of those who have taken the vaccine will suffer adverse effects and/or death. Nobody should ever have to be forced into such a decision!

  More than 97 percent of current hospitalizations across the country are among those who are unvaccinated, according to the CDC Director, Rochelle Walensky, and almost all COVID-19 deaths, which climbed 26 percent in the past week, are among people who have not received a shot. “There is a clear message that is coming through: This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” Walensky said. “We are seeing outbreaks of cases in parts of the country that have low vaccination coverage because unvaccinated people are at risk, and communities that are fully vaccinated are generally faring well.”
  
 

  The COVID-19 virus still poses a threat in Yuma County. Like elsewhere throughout the nation, we are seeing an increase of infections in our area, with the new Delta variant of the virus “spreading more than twice as easily from one person to another compared with earlier strains,” according to Yuma County Health Director Diana Gomez. The Yuma County COVID Early Warning Sewage Testing project has found that concentrations of the virus have been increasing for the past three weeks in several samples taken across Yuma County. The project, which tests samples of sewage at multiple locations, has shown an increasing presence of the virus that continues to spread to more areas in the County. 
  
 

  “Viruses mutate and change to adapt and survive. That’s what viruses do,” Gomez said. “People infected with the Delta variant have higher viral loads-meaning more virus in their body which makes it more contagious.” Gomez says that vaccines remain the most effective tool in protecting yourself and others against the virus because they help protect you against severe illness, hospitalization and death associated with the Delta virus.” Children under the age of 12, are still not eligible to receive the vaccine, therefore high vaccination coverage amongst the rest of the population is needed to help reduce the spread of the virus”
  
 

  The Yuma County Health District continues to provide free COVID-19 vaccinations 8:30 to 11:30 am, Monday – Thursday. People must make an appointment by calling 928-317-4550 or 928-317-4687. A list of other locations offering the vaccine in Yuma County can be found by visiting the Arizona Department of Health Services’ Vaccine Finder. 
  
 

  “As much as I wish we were, we’re not done with COVID-19 yet,” Gomez said. “Getting vaccinated is a tremendous service to yourself, your children, your co-workers, and your community.”

  Más del 97 por ciento de las hospitalizaciones actuales en todo el país se encuentran entre las personas que no están vacunadas, según la directora de los CDC, Rochelle Walensky, y casi todas las muertes por COVID-19, que aumentaron un 26 por ciento en la última semana, se encuentran entre personas que no han recibido una vacunacion. ""Hay un mensaje claro que está llegando: esto se está convirtiendo en una pandemia de personas no vacunadas"", dijo Walensky. “Estamos viendo brotes de casos en partes del país que tienen una cobertura de vacunación baja porque las personas no vacunadas están en riesgo y las comunidades que están completamente vacunadas generalmente están bien.”
  
 

  El virus COVID-19 todavía representa una amenaza en el condado de Yuma. Como en otras partes del país, estamos viendo un aumento de infecciones en nuestra área, con la nueva variante Delta del virus ""propagándose más del doble de fácil de una persona a otra en comparación con las cepas anteriores,” según la directora de salud del condado de Yuma, Diana Gómez.

El proyecto, que analiza muestras de aguas residuales en varios lugares, ha mostrado una presencia cada vez mayor del virus que continúa propagándose a más áreas del condado.
  
 

  “Los virus mutan y cambian para adaptarse y sobrevivir. Eso es lo que hacen los virus,” dijo Gómez. ""Las personas infectadas con la variante Delta tienen cargas virales más altas, lo que significa más virus en su cuerpo, lo que lo hace más contagioso.” Gomez dice que las vacunas siguen siendo la herramienta más eficaz para protegerse a sí mismo y a los demás contra el virus porque lo ayudan a protegerse contra enfermedades graves, hospitalizaciones y muertes asociadas con el virus Delta.” Los niños menores de 12 años todavía no son elegibles para recibir la vacuna, por lo tanto, se necesita una alta cobertura de vacunación entre el resto de la población para ayudar a reducir la propagación del virus.”
  
 

  El Distrito de Salud del Condado de Yuma continúa proporcionando vacunas COVID-19 gratuitas de 8:30 a 11:30 am, de lunes a jueves. Las personas deben hacer una cita llamando al 928-317-4550 o al 928-317-4687. Puede encontrar una lista de otros lugares que ofrecen la vacuna en el condado de Yuma visitando el Buscador de vacunas del Departamento de Servicios de Salud de Arizona.

3.00067E+15,"The science is clear: the new delta variant of COVID-19 is more transmissible than the strains that were dominant in 2020, and poses a higher risk to our children. Masking and social distancing remain the most effective ways to lower transmission between people, and vaccination is the most effective way to reduce your risk of serious illness or death if you contract the virus. In other words: masking protects others, the vaccine protects you, and social distancing protects everyone.
  
 

  Last school year, the Glynn County Board of Education wisely mandated indoor masking in schools.  
  
 

  This year, children under the age of 12 still don’t have the option to be vaccinated, and our county is experiencing a large surge in cases: a 64% increase in COVID-19 inpatients at the Brunswick SGHS campus in the last 6 days (from 42 on 29 July to 69 on 4 Aug). The CDC’s guidance for COVID-19 prevention in K-12 schools was released on 9 July, and recommends universal indoor masking for all teachers, staff, students and visitors, regardless of vaccination status.
  
 

  Despite these facts, last week the BoE reversed their policy from last year and voted 6-1 to begin the 2021-2022 school year without a mask mandate. Mr John Madala was the only board member to vote against removing the mask mandate.
  
 

  It’s not too late for the BoE to take decisive action, trust the science, take the common-sense approach, and require masks in schools just as they did last year. Please reach out to your school board members today and ask them to reconsider this decision, for the safety of our kids and our community.

916625848993394,"THOUGHT OF THE DAY (23) – IT IS A FREE COUNTRY… SORT OF
  
 

  There is nothing in this mini-essay, my esteemed reader, that you haven’t already heard, or knew, or at least suspected. But we tend to forget these things. Creeping normality sets upon us, and we no longer see the changing landscape. 
  
 

  How many times did you hear someone say, or perhaps said it yourself - “it’s a free country”? When using this phraseological whip to defend our position, here is what we tend to forget:
  
 

  1) Structurally we are not a free country. The USA is not an anarchy. Anarchy is a utopian society of individuals who enjoy complete freedom without government. The statement “it’s a free country” would mean we have anarchy. We don’t. Nor are we a full democracy. We do not have majority rule, which is what a democracy really is. 
  
 

  The USA is a Constitutional Republic. That means we have the rule of law. This rule of law is enforced by the state which wields a legitimate monopoly on violence (Max Weber), and a bureaucracy that exists in the service of the state. The State uses violence or the threat of violence (coercion) to achieve its goals and preserve its existence, such as to collect taxes, provide collective defense, prosecute, persecute, and indoctrinate.
  
 

  The State uses psychological manipulation and propaganda, restricts or limits access to information, while rewriting history by mythologizing its accomplishments, and glossing over its failures.
  
 

  2) Despite the feeling of overall individual freedoms and being endlessly told about it by the state, most of our daily lives are spent laboring under autocracies of a quasi-feudal flavor. LLC, stands for Limited Liability Company, where the personal liability of those who run it is limited, or de facto non-existent. It is another way to describe a corporation. With some exceptions, our country is divided into two classes: employers, and employees. As its first order of priority, a corporation dispatches with most individual rights guaranteed by the American Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and various Supreme Court decisions.
  
 

  One person, one vote – gone. Votes are based on a number of shares an individual owns. Equal protection under the law, and right to a fair trial – gone. Instead under corporate law we have perfectly legal “termination without cause”. Freedom of speech - gone. You can’t speak against the company that employs you. Right of assembly – gone. You can’t assemble on private property. Due process – gone. And on, and on, and on it goes.
  
 

  At the top of a corporation sits a feudal lord, a CEO or a founder, who either rules his fiefdom as a complete autocrat, or as ”the first among equals”, that is as the CEO and the Chairman of the Board, presiding over the Board of Directors. They are the modern nobility, the employers, the ruling class, the captains of industry, the oligarchy. Then there are the masses, who are constantly told how free they are. And indeed they are free. Anyone can say something rude and derisive about the president of the country, circulate a profane meme, spread rumors, or call the president incompetent, or a deranged madman who is driving the country into oblivion. You just can’t call the CEO of your company any of those things, because within corporations, where we spend most of our adult lives, we have no freedoms. We are only free to sell our labor-time to make corporate profits. (THOUGHT OF THE DAY (14) – MONEY IS TIME, AN ATTEMPTED MORAL CASE AGAINST ULTRAWEALTH)
  
 

  What is more, now corporations acquired pseudo-personhood that allows them to participate in the general election process, pushing their private interests into the public realm.
  
 

  3) While it is clear that free speech and free expression do not exist in the corporate domain, it is also presently clear that it no longer exists in large public spaces.
  
 

  Google, Facebook, and Twitter have effectively neutered free speech, by actively censoring public discourse. The muse of the triopoly has never been fairness, impartiality, or equality of access. Their goddess has been and will always be – her Royal Majesty- Profit. So what I am about to describe is not a result of some sinister plan or long term conspiracy. It is simply an inevitable trajectory of profit maximization in the public domain.
  
 

  First, the GFT triopoly laid claim to the neutrality of a “platform” or that of a “conduit”. They professed the creation of free and safe spaces of unimpeded public discourse, and robust exchange of ideas that would be unrestricted by corporate gatekeeping. They offered it all for free. We love free stuff! A trifle they wanted in return was as much information about each and every one of us as possible. We gave it to them with alacrity.  
  
 

  Meanwhile, they have fashioned the best of psycho-mathematical models to tap into the psychology of group behavior, hiring the finest psychologists to produce addictive and toxic models of echo chambers and filter bubbles. They sold our private information to advertisers, who then point-targeted us - their addicted users.
  
 

  GFT became highly instrumental in societal polarization, and when that became clear to just about everyone, they decided they had to pre-empt regulatory backlash by arbitrarily engaging in speech censoring and discrimination, based on their own business goals.  
  
 

  Anyone who knows me personally will attest that I am not a fan of the 45th president of the United States. However, every time you see an individual such as a public figure whom you dislike (despise, abhor, fear) being banned from one of those platforms, and you exclaim - “I am glad they finally did it” – think twice. You didn’t win. WE didn’t win. OUR ability to access public resources has just been policed, restricted, and censored. WE have been discriminated against and there is nothing we can do about it! We can’t do anything about it because the U.S. law prioritizes corporate and private interests over public ones. (My Article: DISCRIMINATION AND ITS COUSIN CENSORSHIP)
  
 

  4) A state of emergency or National Emergency is invoked to preserve the interests and the integrity of the United States when it faces dire circumstances. It is a time honored way to impede, suspend, and curtail our rights. In some cases these changes are fully reversed, and yet sometimes these rights are never fully restored. It has been done by various administrations irrespective of the party affiliation.
  
 

  Here are some examples:
  
 

  On April 27, 1861, Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus. That is the legal procedure that prevents the government from holding an individual indefinitely without showing cause.
  
 

  Under the auspices of a National Emergency, 110,000 Japanese Americans were sent to internment camps between 1942-1945 including over 66,000 U.S. citizens!!! Internment camp definition - a prison camp for the confinement of prisoners of war, enemy aliens, political prisoners, etc
  
 

  Closer to our time - under the National Emergency of September 14, 2001 and the follow up on September 23 of the same year, both of which REMAIN CURRENT, a Patriot Act was passed, and the Department of Homeland Security was created with its 90 billion annual budget (officially), which led to a buildup of a giant police state apparatus that collects data and spies on its own citizens.
  
 

  Even more recently, on March 13, 2020, the COVID national emergency was passed. (Personal disclosure: I am fully vaccinated, my grown up kids are fully vaccinated, my wife is fully vaccinated and boosted, and most people I know are fully vaccinated and many are already boosted. I do believe that COVID vaccines are relatively safe and the risk-reward heavily tips the scale in favor of vaccination). With that in mind I am vehemently against the Federal, and State, and corporate mandates that force people into violation of the sovereignty of their body. (THOUGHT OF THE DAY (7) - VACCINATION AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS)
  
 

  In conclusion, I do think that in many areas we are still the freest country in the world. But that is not the right way of looking at things. 
  
 

  The questions are…
  
 

  Are we as free as we CAN BE? Are we as free as we SHOULD BE? Are our democratic institutions under siege and slowly eroding?
  
 

  Those are the questions worth pondering.

These tests tell you whether a person has COVID or not, and they are able to do so for all variants of SARS-CoV-2.

  From discouraging mask mandates that would slow the spread of the deadly delta variant, to encouraging disinformation about vaccines, to shifting blame on the White House — his “leadership” is laughable. There’s no time for excuses when people are losing their lives, our infection rate is climbing, and we have a vaccine that’s proven to be effective in preventing serious illness.
  
 

  Governor Kemp’s behavior is unacceptable, and I won’t stand for it. We need bold, urgent action to stop the spread of the Delta variant, and I’m not afraid to fight for it. If you’re able, can you chip in our average donation of $26 to help keep me in the fight? Unlike our Governor, I’ll never take a dime from special interest groups, lobbyists, or dark money PACS — so our campaign relies on donations from people like you chipping in whenever they can.",VaccineEquity,UrgentPoliticalAdvocacy,authority/subversion,UrgentPoliticalAdvocacy

  But, mandating of the vaccine by employers, schools, the state, etc. is wrong. I am literally watching as dozens of my personal friends who are in health care, (the same people who have spent the last 18 months putting their lives on the line for us) are being told they will be out of a job on September 30th if they don't comply. At the start of the pandemic, they were referred to as *national heroes* for the sacrifices they made for you and me. But now many of them are being thrown out like old dog water. 
  
 

  Yesterday, colleagues of mine who work in the State Assembly were told they must get vaccinated or be terminated September 1st. No option for testing. My friends are losing their jobs. They have families to support, kids to feed, and housing to pay for. They are real people with legit moral and medical concerns about the vaccine. 
  
 

  Mandatory vaccination in this situation is wrong. 
  
 

  I'm not an anti-vaxxer. My kids have received all the standard vaccines. But I'm firmly and decidedly a believer in medical freedom and informed consent. This is a very dangerous slippery slope. I'm all for vaccine education and widespread availability, but this eerily feels like a coordinated effort to break people who won't submit to a dominating, overreaching authority.
  
 

  I wanted to share where I stand on this because I believe it's important for voters to know where candidates are on issues. Even if what I'm saying doesn't go with the mainstream, I'll still speak up for the things I believe are important. It's not always necessary to know every stance on every issue, but something like this is a big deal. I know there are many people who disagree with me on this, and that's ok.

301330588192789,"The Office of the President presents playwright, actor and educator Anna Deavere Smith on Wednesday, November 10 at 7 p.m. in the Michael P. O’Brien Athletic and Recreation Center, 19050 Hill Commons Drive, on the St. Mary’s College of Maryland campus. Part of the Presidential Lecture Series, the event is free of charge and open to the public but reservations are required: www.smcm.edu/presidentlecture.
  
 

  Playwright, actor, and educator Anna Deavere Smith uses her singular brand of theater to explore issues of community, character and diversity in America. The MacArthur Foundation honored Smith with the “Genius” Fellowship for creating “a new form of theater — a blend of theatrical art, social commentary, journalism, and intimate reverie.”
  
 

  Best known for crafting more than 15 one-woman shows drawn from hundreds of interviews, Smith turns these conversations into scripts and transforms herself onstage into a number of characters. In her speaking events, Smith discusses the many “complex identities of America,” and interweaves her discussions with portrayals of people she has interviewed to illustrate the diversity of emotions and points of view on controversial issues.
  
 

  Her most recent play, “Notes from the Field,” looks at the school-to-prison pipeline and injustice and inequality in low-income communities. Winner of an Obie Award and the 2017 Nortel Award for Outstanding Solo Show, “Notes from the Field” was named one of the Top 10 Plays of the year by Time magazine. There is a film adaptation available through HBO and a paperback adaption.
  
 

  In 2012, Smith was awarded the National Humanities Medal, presented by President Obama and in 2015, she was named the Jefferson Lecturer, the nation’s highest honor in the humanities. She also is the recipient of the prestigious Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and most recently, the 2017 Ridenhour Courage Prize and the George Polk Career Award for authentic journalism.
  
 

  Smith’s breakthrough plays, “Fires in the Mirror,” a runner-up for the Pulitzer Prize, and the Tony-nominated “Twilight: Los Angeles,” tackle issues of race and social inequality that have become touchstones of her work. Her portrayals of patients and medical professionals in “Let Me Down Easy” delivered a vivid look at healthcare in the United States. The show aired on PBS’ “Great Performances.”
  
 

  Currently, Smith appears on the ABC’s series “Black-ish” and the ABC legal drama “For the People.” She is probably most recognizable as the hospital administrator on Showtime’s “Nurse Jackie” and the national security adviser on NBC’s “The West Wing.” Her films include “The American President,” “Rachel Getting Married,” and “Philadelphia.”
  
 

  Smith is the founding director of the Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue, which was launched at Harvard University and is now housed at New York University, where she is a Professor at Tisch School of the Arts. Her books include “Letters to a Young Artist” and “Talk to Me: Listening Between the Lines.”
  
 

  She has been an Artist-in-Residence at MTV Networks, the Ford Foundation, and Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. Smith was appointed to Bloomberg Philanthropies’ 2017 U.S. Mayors Challenge Committee, a nationwide competition urging innovative solutions for the toughest issues confronting U.S. cities. She holds honorary degrees from Yale, the University of Pennsylvania and Julliard, among others.

3.05399E+15,"Joanna's stance on COVID-19 issues:
  
 

  What steps do you feel the school district should take to address COVID in schools?
  
 

  In order to keep schools open for in-person learning, we need to continue to layer a number of mitigation strategies including: universal masking, vaccination, 3 feet of physical distancing whenever possible, appropriate ventilation, air purification, and effective cleaning of high contact surfaces. Mitigation strategies should be reevaluated frequently and any changes made should be evidence-based.
  
 

  Should students and teachers be required to wear masks in schools? Why or why not?
  
 

  Everyone entering our schools and our buses should be required to wear a mask at this time, unless medically exempted by their physician. Properly wearing a mask is one of the best mitigation strategies for reducing the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. At this time universal masking in schools, and on buses, is not only mandated, but is the recommendation of the CDC, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, and our own Bucks County Health Department, and should be maintained throughout the District.
  
 

  Should teachers and/or students over the age of 12 be required to be vaccinated against COVID? Why or why not?
  
 

  With the shared goal of keeping our schools open safely for in-person learning, I am in favor of universal vaccination against the virus that causes COVID-19 as a key strategy to ensuring the safest possible learning environment for all our children -- including those with an exemption or exclusion from vaccination.

  For Vaccine Hesitant people. This conversation is with Kevin Ellis, Pharmacy Manager, Albertsons/Sav-On, McCall. Key questions addressed: What regimen and advice would you recommend if a patient presented with COVID-19 symptoms? What sources of information are you currently recommending to people with COVID-19 questions? How are you handling the diverse information if not misinformation related to COVID-19 flowing in our community? What are you saying to someone who wants hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin? Define the available vaccines for COVID-19 in our region of the West Central Mountains of Idaho. How are mRNA vaccines different from past vaccines? What side effects (or earned immunity effects) have we seen locally to the vaccines? Are any vaccines better than others? A pervasive story is that mRNA permanently changes your DNA. How do you respond? Will you recommend a particular vaccine for a particular sub-set of patients? Why? How do you advise a person who is hesitant to take the vaccine? Moderated by Dr. L. Bryan Williams, Social and Bio Ethicist, McCall College, McCall, Idaho. Originally aired on April 10th , 2021.

  Forcing young children to wear masks when the vast majority of their parents no longer have to is cruel - plain and simple. As a mother, I cannot imagine doing that to my kids. When this all started, we didn’t know how at-risk kids were, we didn’t understand how the virus was transmitted, and we didn’t have a vaccine. Now we know that children are at significantly lower risk of serious illness, we know schools aren’t COVID hotspots, and we have not one, but three very effective vaccines.
  
 

  This isn’t complicated. If you want to wear a mask, wear a mask, but it should be a personal choice, and we should respect that choice. This past year has been devastating for our students, and countless kids will struggle for years to make up the ground they lost.
  
 

  This virus is still with us but we know a lot more than we did when it all began. Local leaders should be following the science which has shown for many months that kids do not face the same level of risk from COVID. Most importantly, students should feel safe in their environments, and if that means they want to wear a mask, it should be their choice.

  Opinion by Jennifer Rubin
  Columnist, The Washington Post
  
 

  November 23, 2020 at 1:09 p.m. EST
  
 

  Georgia’s Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who each face a runoff election on Jan. 5, have privately indicated that they think President Trump is a goner. That’s according to a call that the senators had with Republican strategist Karl Rove and supporters. The Post reports:
  
 

  “What we’re going to have to do is make sure we get all the votes out from the general and get them back out,” Perdue said of core Republican voters. “That’s always a hard thing to do in a presidential year, particularly this year, given that President Trump, it looks like now, may not be able to hold out.”
  
 

  Perdue added that “we don’t know that” yet — and said he fully supports Trump and his dispute of the results in several states. But, he said, “we’re assuming that we’re going to be standing out here alone. And that means that we have to get the vote out, no matter what the outcome of that adjudication is on the recount in two states and some lawsuits, and others. Kelly and I can’t wait for that.”
  
 

  At the same time, they are hoping that anti-Trump Republican voters will come out for them. “I’m talking about people that may have voted for Biden but now may come back and vote for us because there was an anti-Trump vote in Georgia,” Perdue said on the call. “And we think some of those people, particularly in the suburbs, may come back to us. And I’m hopeful of that.” This he believes even though he and Loeffler trashed the results of a democratic election and demanded the resignation of Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, based on false accusations that he mishandled the electoral process.
  
 

  But why should such voters back Perdue and Loeffler, given that they have defended Trump’s impeachable conduct, ignored the president’s racism, refused to demand that he concede a clear election defeat (including a 12,000-vote loss in Georgia, which is now certified) and stalled (along with the rest of the GOP Senate) any covid-19 relief package? Their cynicism — in trying to not offend the enraged, anti-democratic president while attempting to appear normal enough to win back mainstream voters — reflects the depths of their party’s depravity.
  
 

  Republicans have no positive message. None. They simply want to smear Democrats as radical threats to Georgians. The Post reports:
  
 

  “This is really not about messaging. It’s not about persuasion in my race. It’s more about getting the vote out,” Perdue said. He later said: “We have to remind people of what the Democrats will do. It has nothing to do with Kelly or me.
  
 

  Actually, it has everything to do with these two Republicans. Voters and media should demand that they publicly answer some fundamental questions:
  
 

  ¤ Did Trump lose Georgia?
  If there is no evidence of fraud, isn’t Trump attempting to overthrow a democratic election?
  
 

  ¤ How is this different from the conduct of a tin-pot dictator?
  
 

  ¤ How can you uphold your oath of office if you refuse to accept the will of the people expressed in a democratic election?
  
 

  ¤ Do you support efforts to disenfranchise millions of voters around the country — who are disproportionately Black — with baseless allegations of fraud? How do you expect any African American to support you?
  
 

  ¤ If a Democratic senator contacted Georgia election officials and urged them to throw out votes, as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) allegedly did, would you demand an inquiry? Or that such a senator resign? Why are you silent on Graham’s alleged actions?
  
 

  ¤ Should state lawmakers overthrow the will of voters in their own states by substituting in their own slate of Trump electors?
  
 

  ¤ Should we prosecute people who attempt to intimidate election officials to subvert the results of an election?
  
 

  ¤ Why have you not insisted the transition begin to prevent any national security lapses or glitches in the covid-19 vaccination effort?
  
 

  ¤ If you are reelected, will you agree to confirm qualified, mainstream executive branch nominees?
  
 

  ¤ If you are reelected, will you agree to forgo a filibuster on a stimulus package with a bipartisan majority?
  
 

  ¤ If you are reelected, will you oppose baseless inquiries into debunked allegations against Hillary Clinton, President Barack Obama and President-elect Joe Biden’s son?
  
 

  Perdue and Loeffler certainly know Trump lost their state and the general election. They nevertheless lack the nerve and decency to uphold the most fundamental principles of democracy. They have been rubber stamps for Trump, even at the expense of delivering much-needed relief to their constituents. If ever two senators forfeited their moral authority and proved themselves unworthy of the voters’ trust, it is these two.

  The results are in and the Boys & Girls Club of Carlsbad very deservedly won “Best in Show” at this year’s Electric Light Parade. The Club had a huge turnout, and we’re thankful that the weather cooperated Saturday evening. Zia Bike & Board Shop took first place in the “Best Carlsbad Christmas” Category, while Winter Wonderland and the Noland Family Float also placed. Judges in front of the county courthouse scored each float as it passed by, and prizes were later awarded by the beach. 
  
 

  TLC Health, meanwhile, won first place in the “Most Griswold Christmas” category, with Carlsbad Head Start and the Albertsons A team also receiving recognition. Thank you again to everyone who made this year’s parade one of the best we’ve ever had in terms of participation and attendance. 
  
 

  One of the next big holiday events in Carlsbad is the Vintage Cactus Christmas taking place from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the civic center on Dec. 4. This event will feature multiple vendors, boutiques and gift shops, and free gift bags will be available for the first 100 shoppers. For more information, please contact vintagecactustradedays@gmail.com.

  Carlsbad’s wrestling team also has two tournaments this week: The Piedra Vista Duals and the Cavern City Tournament are both scheduled to take place in Carlsbad, according to the schedule. The Carlsbad Christmas Invitational swim meet is also scheduled for Dec. 4. It’s going to be a busy weekend at Carlsbad High School.
