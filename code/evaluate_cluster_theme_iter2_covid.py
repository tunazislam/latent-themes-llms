    "Thank you to local, state and federal officials for prioritizing our residents and staff members to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. We are vaccinated! #GetVaccinatedLA",
    "SOME OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS SO FAR (UPDATED) \n Spread the word. \n 1. Rejoined the Paris Agreement, an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), on climate change mitigation, adaptation, and finance, signed in 2016. (Trump withdrew the U.S. from this agreement.) \n 2. In a letter to UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres, Biden rescinded Donald Trump's July 2020 intended U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization. \n 3. In January, signed ten executive orders related to the country's COVID-19 response and vaccination efforts. These included Ensuring a Data-Driven Response to COVID-19 and Future High-Consequence Public Health Threats, Establishing the COVID-19 Pandemic Testing Board and Ensuring a Sustainable Public Health Workforce for COVID-19 and Other Biological Threats, Supporting the Reopening and Continuing Operation of Schools and Early Childhood Education Providers, and activating the Defense Production Act in order to speed up vaccine distribution. \n 4. Signed an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal employees to $15 per hour.\n 5. Withdrew Trump's travel ban from Muslim-majority countries.\n 6. Signed the American Rescue Plan into law. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, also called the COVID-19 Stimulus Package or American Rescue Plan, is a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill passed by the 117th United States Congress and signed into law by President Biden on March 11, 2021, to speed up the United States' recovery from the economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing recession. First proposed on January 14, 2021, the package builds upon many of the measures in the CARES Act from March 2020 and in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, from December. \n 7. Created a task force to reunite children separated from their families as a result of the Trump administration's policy of taking children and even babies away from their parents to discourage refugees from coming to the southern U.S. border. The Biden Administration has reunited over 50 families and has recently launched a web portal, together.gov, that will allow parents to contact the U.S. government to expedite the process of reunification. \n 8. Announced sanctions on Russia over the worst-ever hack of U.S. government agencies. (Stands in contrast to Trump's extreme reluctance to do the same.) \n 9. Biden followed through on his promise to end the war in Afghanistan, America's longest war. Biden and the U.S. military did an extraordinary job of evacuating more than 120,000 Americans and Afghan allies in 2 weeks. \n 10. Made all adults eligible for COVID-19 vaccination by April 19th, 2 weeks ahead of schedule. As of now 70% of adults in the U.S. have had at least one COVID-19 shot. Although there's been a recent increase due to people who still haven't been vaccinated contracting the Delta variant, overall the number of daily new cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. has fallen substantially since Biden became president. \n 11. Added over 3 million jobs in the first 6 months of his presidency. \n 12. Signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. Prompted by a nearly 150% increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans after the breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic, the legislation, introduced by Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., and Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, aims to make the reporting of hate crimes more accessible at the local and state levels by boosting public outreach and ensuring reporting resources are available online in multiple languages. It also directs the Department of Justice to designate a point person to expedite the review of hate crimes related to COVID-19 and authorizes grants to state and local governments to conduct crime-reduction programs to prevent and respond to hate crimes. A big change from Trump calling COVID-19 the 'China virus' and the 'Kung Flu.' \n 13. Suspended oil drilling leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. \n 14. Signed an executive order expanding voting access that directs the heads of all federal agencies to submit proposals for their respective agencies to promote voter registration and participation within 200 days, while assisting states in voter registration under the National Voter Registration Act. In addition, the order instructs the General Services Administration to modernize the federal government's Vote.gov portal. \n 15. Signed an executive order to restore collective bargaining power for federal workers. \n 16. The American Rescue Plan fulfills Biden's promise to expand the Affordable Care Act, for two years. With its expanded subsidies for health plans under the Affordable Care Act, the coronavirus relief bill makes insurance more affordable, and puts health care on the ballot in 2022. \n 17. Issued an executive order that promotes more competition in the economy. It urges agencies to crack down on anti-competitive practices in sectors from agriculture to drugs and labor. Fully implemented, the effort will help lower Americans' internet costs and lower drug prices, among other benefits. The order instructs antitrust agencies to focus on labor, healthcare, technology and agriculture as they address a laundry list of issues that have irritated consumers, and in the case of drug prices, has bankrupted some. \n 18. Signed the Crime Victims Fund Act, a bill to bolster a fund used to support victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and other crimes. \n 19. Signed a bill making Juneteenth the eleventh federal holiday. Juneteenth, now officially Juneteenth National Independence Day, commemorats the emancipation of African-American slaves. It is also often observed for celebrating African-American culture. \n 20. Signed an executive order to increase refugee admissions and allow a safe haven for about 125,000 refugees. \n 21. Cancelled student loan debt for more than 300,000 Americans with severe disabilities that leave them unable to earn significant incomes. \n 22. Announced 'Path out of the Pandemic,' a plan which includes new wide-ranging requirements for federal employees and employees of companies with more than 100 workers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine or undergo regular testing at least once a week, with no option of testing for unvaccinated federal employees. \n 23. Biden is currently working with Congress to pass 2 major bills that will invest in infrastructure as well as other priorities such as providing 2 free years of community college, child care and universal pre-k, Medicare expansion, an extended child tax credit, cutting prescription drug prices, paid family and medical leave and combatting climate change. Liberal and moderate Democrats, with help from Biden, have been making steady progress in working out their differences to pass these bills."

The reason was reported cases of abnormal blood clotting with low platelet counts (thrombosis) with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS, in people who received this vaccine. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine üíâ was determined to be safe after an in-depth review. However, it may be more dangerous for some people. Women ages 18-49, who are most at risk for TTS, may choose to get a different COVID-19 vaccine.  Right now, it looks like these specific types of blood clots are an extremely rare reaction.

ERC has done so much over the last 20 years to advocate and provide representation for some of the most vulnerable and marginalized workers in our district. When the pandemic hit, we saw so many left unemployed and confused about how to access support services. ERC was one of the first organizations that worked to transform its normal operation into a resource hub to meet the immediate needs of the community. Just in the last year, ERC has helped organize Census outreach events, COVID vaccination sites, assisted with filling out and submitting EDD claims, partnered with other organizations to provide rental and utility assistance, and helped establish a pantry to distribute food to those in need. As part of its broader mission, the nonprofit also provided resources for disadvantaged workers to stand up against wage theft, health and safety issues in the workplace, and discrimination, regardless of their immigration status. That‚Äôs just a few examples of the countless ways ERC has supported and helped provide relief to working families in our community during such a difficult year.

Here are five‚Äîfrom Covid vaccine ‚Äúpassports‚Äù to assessing the ‚Äúintellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity‚Äù at state colleges and universities‚Äîthat will have a direct impact in your life. \n 1. Outraged by an unfounded perception that social media companies are biased against conservatives, Republican lawmakers passed a measure (SB 7072) that seeks to prohibit social media companies from banning political candidates that violate their terms of agreement. Companies could face fines of $250,000 a day for statewide candidates. \n 2. New bill (HB 529) requires all K-12 public schools to hold moments of silence each day. Gov. Ron DeSantis stated that ‚Äúour founding fathers‚Äù did not believe in ‚Äúthe idea you can just push God out of every institution.‚Äù Although teachers cannot recommend what students do with that time, opponents believe the measure promotes prayer in schools. \n 3. The GOP-controlled Legislature passed HB 233, a measure that requires conducting surveys to assess the ‚Äúintellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity‚Äù at state colleges and universities. Those who oppose it fear that Holocaust deniers, alt-right racists and QAnon adherents will seek to peddle false theories in classrooms. \n 4. Following DeSantis‚Äô lead, lawmakers approved SB 2006, a measure that prevents businesses, schools, and government agencies from requiring people to show documentation‚Äîso-called ‚Äúvaccine passports‚Äù‚Äîcertifying COVID-19 vaccinations, before entering the premises. The law also gives the governor power to override local orders during health crises, despite Florida still being among the states with the highest number of infections. \n 5.

    "FYI. The state superintendent sent this today to each district superintendent today. Attacking your local school board for following Governor Pritzker‚Äôs Executive Order is unproductive. It is Governor Pritzker who is responsible for the current policy. Illinois State Board of Education: Office of the Superintendent \n Dear Superintendents:  \n  I know many of you are in a difficult position. The pandemic has required us to navigate changing circumstances and guidance. I deeply appreciate your leadership and the courage and integrity you have shown in tremendously challenging times. Many of you have requested clarity on the action the Illinois State Board of Education will take to enforce the universal indoor masking requirement, and this communication seeks to provide that clarity.  \n  As you know, Executive Order 2021-18, which went into effect last Wednesday, requires that all students, staff, and visitors wear masks indoors in all P-12 schools in Illinois. Governor Pritzker took this action after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended it.  \n The purpose of the universal indoor masking requirement is to ensure all students can safely attend school in-person this fall. We know that consistent and correct mask use is the simplest, most effective way to keep students safely in school, where they can learn and grow to their fullest potential. Masks work best when everyone wears one. Research conducted by the CDC found that schools are safe when they have prevention strategies in place, as documented in the updated guidance from ISBE and the Illinois Department of Public Health. \n The Delta variant is causing a surge in cases and hospitalizations, and masking is a critical strategy to protect students‚Äô access to in-person learning and to keep students, staff, and the community around them safe. We don‚Äôt throw our umbrella away in a rainstorm because we‚Äôre not getting wet. We have to keep our umbrella up until the storm passes.  \n The executive order has the force of law. I understand the pressure some school and district leaders may be facing from community members, and I will provide you with every support to understand, communicate, and comply with the order. \n However, noncompliance is not an option. I will not compromise the health and safety of students or staff, nor will I risk even one child‚Äôs life.  \n Local boards of education, schools, and school districts do not have the authority to deny the Governor‚Äôs Executive Order requiring universal indoor masking in schools. Doing so not only puts students‚Äô health and safety at risk but also opens the district to extraordinary legal liability ‚Äì potentially without any insurance to cover damages. I strongly recommend that each district consult with its legal counsel and insurer to fully understand the repercussions. \n Further, ISBE has and will use its regulatory authority, pursuant to 23 Ill Admin. Code 1.20, to ensure school districts protect students and staff; if school districts fail to do so, this risks State recognition. \n A district would have multiple opportunities to remedy the deficiencies that present a health hazard or a danger to students or staff before becoming unrecognized. A district would first have its recognition status changed to ‚ÄúOn Probation‚Äù and would be asked to submit a corrective action plan. Failure to address the deficiencies would lead to nonrecognition, meaning total loss of access to state funding and loss of the school's ability to engage in any Illinois High School Association and Illinois Elementary School Association athletic competitions. \n These are not steps anyone at ISBE wishes to take nor should these steps be necessary. School districts have the moral and legal obligation to follow public health requirements and guidance to keep their students and staff safe.  \n Wearing a mask is simple, safe, and easy. I know it can be uncomfortable sometimes, but so are football helmets and seatbelts. Sometimes we have to bear a little discomfort for the sake of safety and because it‚Äôs the law.  \n We have so many important issues to face as we start the school year, and we want to start the year off with positivity for all our students. I ask that you respect that there is a mask requirement, communicate this to your school communities, and celebrate the return to in-person learning.  \n Thank you for your partnership and support. \n Sincerely,   \n Dr. Carmen I. Ayala  \n State Superintendent of Education  \n Illinois State Board of Education  \n Visit https://www.isbe.net/",
    "New York school mask mandates struck down, it was a great legal opinion, actually one of the best COVID legal opinions I have seen. Let‚Äôs talk about what happens next.",
    "This recommendation from the Superintendent was passed by the board at tonight's meeting. The first option was the plan that was approved. I still think masks should be optional now and up to the parent/child or employee. They again referred to the unclear county 'quarantine' These healthcare decisions should always be made by the parent/student and employees. I do not agree with any mandates including masks."

    "Dear Fellow Arlington Residents, I am pleased to announce that I am running for re-election to the Arlington Select Board. The past three years have been an incredible experience. I continue to learn from my colleagues and town residents and grow as a Select Board Member each day. I am proud to represent a diverse, vibrant community, whose residents actively participate in the political process and hold their elected officials to a very high standard. The last term has not gone by without challenges. As a community, we had to solve the problem of a crumbling high school, while maintaining fiscal stability and continuing to provide top notch town services to residents. I am grateful to our voters for overwhelmingly choosing to invest in Arlington‚Äôs school children. In light of a national reckoning on racial injustice, we have had many discussions to identify racism that still exists both nationally and here in town. Town officials and staff have collaborated with experts and our residents in efforts to end racial discrimination in Arlington and ensure that we are truly a municipality where all are welcome. We have made significant progress, but there much more work to do. Soaring property values in Arlington have led to a housing affordability crisis in town. Almost universally, officials and residents have expressed a commitment to take action to increase affordable housing. We have engaged in an ongoing effort to review zoning bylaws to identify common sense changes that will help to realize this important goal. In the next year, we will take action to break down barriers to affordable housing and support diversity in Arlington. In the midst of a global pandemic that has shocked our lives, strained families and businesses, and put our population at serious risk, town officials have partnered with residents to take necessary precautions to keep our town safe. I am truly proud of the way Arlington coalesced in response to COVID-19 to ensure that the town remains a safe place to live. I want to thank our town staff, our first responders, and all our essential workers for their incredible efforts during this difficult time. As the vaccine rolls out and we see light at the end of the tunnel, it is imperative for town government and residents to support our local businesses to ensure that they can remain open or re-open when safe to do so. While we have achieved much in last three years, there is significant work ahead of us. With uncertainty in future revenues, both locally and at the state level, we need to find creative ways to maintain fiscal stability and honor the commitments we made to our school aged children and seniors. We need to continue to engage in community conversations about race, learn from our differences, and work toward true racial equity. And, we need to work collaboratively with town officials, residents, and interested parties to alleviate our housing affordability crisis. I look forward to addressing these issues in addition to our ongoing efforts to modernize our transportation infrastructure and protect our open spaces. There is far more that unites our residents than divides us, and through collaboration and mutual respect, I am confident that we can build on our progress and achieve these important goals. I respectfully ask for one of your two votes on April 10th. Thank You! John V.

    "Market Highlights - April 26th, 2021 | Macroeconomic data continue to show a post-winter storm rebound. While Covid increasingly appears to be under control here in the U.S., India has driven global cases to new highs. The combination of pent-up demand, stimulus checks, and increasing vaccinations is contributing to economic boom-like conditions. We continue to monitor mounting inflationary pressures and will be focusing on those companies that have pricing power to protect or sustain profit margins.  The Biden administration is 'going BIG' with deficit spending, seemingly attempting to accomplish all of its policy objectives at once. Meanwhile, we expect the Federal Reserve to continue to maintain its highly accommodative monetary policy for the time being. We are testing limits of how far we can go with massive deficits, debt and central bank balance sheet expansion with uncertain longer-term consequences. We are now roughly one third of the way through earnings season and so far both the rate and magnitude of earnings beats have surprised to the upside, driving further upward revisions to S&P 500 earnings estimates.  Bond yields, meanwhile, have taken a breather, providing highly-valued growth stocks (and home buyers) a reprieve for now. We see stock valuations as full and investor complacency as elevated ‚Äì preconditions for increased market volatility in the weeks and months ahead. Risks continue to be an unexpected vaccination snafu or a troublesome new Covid variant, an inflation scare that causes a ‚Äúdisorderly‚Äù rise in bond yields, changes in Federal Reserve policy stance, and rising taxes. However, we remain broadly constructive on the market on the basis of highly accommodative monetary policy, massive fiscal stimulus, increasing vaccinations and rising S&P profit estimates.

It‚Äôs feels like a Florida summer absent the huge bugs and bad drivers. I‚Äôm so ready for college football and cooler weather as the calendar turns next week. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs on my mind as Summer 2021 wanes. ‚Ä¢ For the first time in years, I intentionally skipped writing an investment outlook this summer, was hoping no one would notice. We‚Äôre still doing copious research and reading too many investment commentaries, but these are historically peculiar times with no historical context. ‚Ä¢ We see status quo investment conditions for the balance of 2021 and have our client portfolios in a fully invested position avoiding fixed interest rate credit - investment grade and high yield bonds - as much as possible.‚Ä¢ The robust US economic reopening in 2021 is still ascendant. Nearly every business we know is booming; many, however, are still held back by a severe labor pool shortage and supply chain bottlenecks. ‚Ä¢ More good news arrives next week - federal unemployment benefits FINALLY end on September 4th. It was silly fiscal policy to pay workers more money to not work for so long; the cessation should really help solve the labor crisis.‚Ä¢ We‚Äôre not overly concerned about the Delta COVID variant derailing economic momentum. Only the unvaccinated are getting really sick and there‚Äôs scant interest in a return to mass shutdowns. Moreover, there‚Äôs evidence that Delta cases are starting to peak despite the uneasy hospitalization headlines. Get vaccinated for your loved ones.‚Ä¢ The FDA approval of the Pfizer vaccine last week was big news. The FDA did not succumb to political pressure to shortcut their normal new drug review process, which lends even more credence the Pfizer vaccine is safe. Immediately after Pfizer received FDA approval, many employers nationwide announced vaccination requirements to come to work. Good.‚Ä¢ Mandatory vaccinations coupled with no more gratuitous unemployment benefits should fix the US labor shortage and sustain the economic momentum.

    "üö®üö®üö®BREAKING: The man suspected of being ‚ÄòQ‚Äô in QAnon just announced he‚Äôs running for our seat üö®üö®üö® We knew that our opponents would be extreme, but now that one of the leaders of QAnon is in the race, we need to pull out all of the stops. This is the same group of far-right, white supremacists that propagated dangerous conspiracy theories about the legitimacy of the 2020 Presidential election and the presence of microchips in the COVID-19 vaccine. We‚Äôre launching a rapid response fund to make sure our campaign has the resources to fight back and help Democrats keep the House majority. Will you rush a donation to fight back against QAnon?",
